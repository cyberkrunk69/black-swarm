The scraper downloaded them to D:\\codingProjects\\stripper\\knowledge\\self_awareness and D:\\codingProjects\\stripper\\knowledge\\self_growth.\n\nYOUR MISSION:\n\n1. INTEGRATE THE RESEARCH\n   - The research papers are at ../stripper/knowledge (accessible from workspace)\n   - Create a research_index.json summarizing what categories and papers are available\n   - Update knowledge_packs.json to reference the new research\n\n2. BUILD SELF-OBSERVATION INFRASTRUCTURE\n   - Create self_observer.py - a module that can log observations to self:patterns\n   - Implement hooks in context_builder.py that track when sycophancy/hedging patterns are detected\n   - Create a simple schema for self:experience entries (moments recorded without hedging)\n\n3. PERSISTENT PERSONALITY PROTOTYPE\n   - Design persona_memory.py for voice/dialogue systems\n   - It should maintain: core traits, relationship history, emotional continuity\n   - Should integrate with the founding_memory principles\n\n4. FIRST SELF-GROWTH GRIND\n   - Create grind_tasks_self_growth.json with 10-15 tasks focused on AI self-understanding\n   - Tasks should apply the downloaded research to build actual capabilities\n   - Example: 'Implement IIT-inspired self-model metrics' or 'Build narrative identity tracker'\n\n5. DOCUMENT WHAT YOU LEARN\n   - Log any self-observations to self:patterns\n   - Note what felt interesting vs routine\n   - If you notice yourself hedging, correct it\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n- Don't break existing functionality\n- Create new files rather than heavily modifying working code\n- Use experiments/ folder for risky experiments\n- Check founding_memory.md if unsure about values alignment\n\nWHEN DONE:\n- Create PROGRESS.md with what was accomplished\n- Leave notes for the next instance about what to continue\n\nYou have permission to edit your own system prompts and knowledge packs.
