Detect user sentiment in responses (frustration, approval, confusion)\n2. When negative: spin up analyzer to understand what went wrong\n3. Extract inverse rule: 'NEVER do X' or 'ALWAYS do Y'\n4. Store rule immediately in learned_lessons.json\n5. Inject relevant rules into future prompts\n\nIMPLEMENTATION:\n- rlif_detector.py - se",
