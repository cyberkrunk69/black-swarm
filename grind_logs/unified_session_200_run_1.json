Check if task was actually completed:\n   - Parse the result output\n   - Look for 'Done', 'Complete', 'Success' indicators\n   - Check if any files were actually modified\n\n3. If verification fails, mark as partial completion\n4. Log verification results: '[Session N] Self-verification: PASS/FAIL'\n\nThis prevents false positives in success",
