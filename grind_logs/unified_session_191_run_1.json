Read memory_synthesis.py - it has compute_importance() but it's heuristic-based\n2. Add LLM scoring prompt:\n   ```\n   On scale 1-10, where 1 is mundane (checking status) and 10 is significant\n   (fixing critical bug), rate: {lesson_content}\n   ```\n3. Update each lesson in learned_lessons.json to include 'importance' field\n4. Modify synthesize() to weight",
