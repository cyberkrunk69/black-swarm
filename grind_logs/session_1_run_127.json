Scans the `experiments/` directory and lists all experiment sub\u2011directories whose modification time is older than 24\u202fhours.\n2. For each listed directory, determines whether it contains any non\u2011empty files and whether its contents are duplicates of other experiment directories (e.g., by comparing file hashes or sizes).\n3. Deletes only those directories that are either completely empty or contain only duplicate output, **never** deleting directories from the current day.\n4. Keeps directories that have unique, substantive output.\n5. After processing, prints a concise report: `X deleted, Y kept, Z bytes freed`.\nThe script must be safe (use try/except, confirm deletions, optionally support a `--dry-run` flag), and must not rely on external non\u2011standard packages.\n", "acceptance_criteria": "A runnable `prune_experiments.py` script is present in the repository root. When executed:\n- It outputs a list of experiment directories older than 24\u202fh.\n- It correctly identifies empty or duplicate directories and deletes only those, leaving today\u2019s directories untouched.\n- The final console output matches the pattern `X deleted, Y kept, Z bytes freed` with accurate numbers.\n- The script handles errors gracefully and includes a `--dry-run` option that performs all checks and prints the would\u2011be actions without deleting anything.\n- No new third\u2011party dependencies are introduced."}], "next_role": "CODER", "critic_review": {"score": 1.0, "issues": [], "feedback": ["[OK] Code quality looks good!"], "passed": true, "timestamp": "2026-02-03T20:17:28.121775", "context": {"filename": "/app/grind_logs/session_1_run_127.json", "task": "PRUNE: experiments/ directory\n\nThere are 1824 experiment directories, most are garbage duplicates.\n\n1.
