BUILD dependency graph\n4. EXECUTE independent tasks in parallel\n5. WAIT for dependencies before starting dependent tasks\n\nDESIGN:\n- Task dependency annotation format\n- Dependency graph builder\n- Parallel execution scheduler\n- Completion detection\n- Dynamic re-scheduling as tasks complete\n\nOUTPUT: TASK_DEPENDENCY_DESIGN.md wi",
