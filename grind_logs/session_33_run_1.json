Break into sub-tasks as needed.\n\n## CORE FEATURES:\n\n### 1. DRAGGABLE NODES\n- User can click and drag any node in a task tree\n- Nodes maintain their tree relationships but can be repositioned\n- Connection lines update dynamically as nodes move\n- Positions persist during session (localStorage?)\n\n### 2. AUTO-SCALING TREES\n- As a tree grows (more nodes), it should SHRINK proportionally\n- Trees should never fill the entire screen\n- User should always be able to see the big picture\n- Smooth scaling animation as nodes are added\n- Minimum readable size (don't shrink to unreadable)\n\n### 3. FLOATING CHAT MODULE\n- Chat input is a draggable, floating panel\n- User can move it anywhere on the workspace\n- Can be collapsed/minimized\n- Remembers position\n\n### 4. COLLAPSIBLE TASK TREES (Mini Mode)\n- User can collapse a running task tree into a compact form\n- Thunk-thunk-thunk animation collapses nodes into each other\n- Collapsed state shows: small icon + running summary text\n- Summary updates in real-time showing current status\n- User retains visibility without visual clutter\n- Click to expand back to full tree view\n\n### 5. MULTI-TREE WORKSPACE\n- Multiple parallel task trees can exist simultaneously\n- Each tree is independently draggable and scalable\n- Trees don't overlap (or if they do, z-index management)\n- User can arrange their workspace as they prefer\n\n### 6. SMART LAYOUT\n- Trees auto-arrange to avoid overlap on spawn\n- Anchoring system: trees anchor to user-set positions\n- New trees spawn in available space\n- Resize/reflow when window size changes\n\n## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:\nBreak into sub-tasks:\n1. Draggable nodes (interact.js or vanilla drag API)\n2. Auto-scaling system (transform: scale() based on node count)\n3. Floating chat module (draggable panel component)\n4. Collapse/expand tree animation\n5. Multi-tree state management\n6. Smart layout algorithm\n\n## OUTPUT:\n- Updated dashboard_vision.js with interaction system\n- Updated dashboard_vision.css with scaling/drag styles\n- UIUX_INTERACTION_SPEC.md documenting the system", "session_id": 33, "run": 1}}, "quality_score": 1.0, "critic_feedback": ["[OK] Code quality looks good!"], "critic_retry_count": 0}
