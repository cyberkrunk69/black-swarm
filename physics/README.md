# Physics

Shared mathematical/physics-style primitives used by swarm runtime components.

Current module:

- `math_utils.py` - vector similarity, distances, normalization, and utility
  transforms used by ranking and intent systems.

This folder is intentionally independent from legacy swarm generation code.
