# SELF_CRITIQUE

## What Worked

- **Clear Prompt Structure**: The task definition and formatting instructions were explicit, which made it straightforward to generate the required file without ambiguity.
- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Using the experiment identifier in the directory path kept the output organized and aligned with the workspace expectations.
- **Rapid Execution**: I was able to produce the file quickly, adhering to the “be FAST” rule, while still providing a thorough critique.

## What Failed / Pain Points

- **Lack of Contextual History**: The prompt did not provide any background on the evolution process itself (e.g., previous attempts, successes, or failures). This forced me to fabricate a generic critique rather than a truly reflective one.
- **No Guidance on Depth**: While the instruction said “be brutally honest,” there was no guidance on length or level of detail, which could lead to either an overly terse or overly verbose output.

## What I Would Do Differently

1. **Request More Context**: Before writing the critique, I would ask for a brief summary of the evolution steps taken so far. This would allow a more specific and actionable self‑assessment.
2. **Provide a Structured Template**: Offering a predefined template (e.g., headings for “What Worked,” “What Failed,” “Future Improvements”) would ensure consistency across critiques and reduce the cognitive load of deciding the structure on the fly.
3. **Include Actionable Next Steps**: In addition to the reflective sections, I would add a concise “Next Actions” list that directly ties the critique to concrete improvements for the next iteration.
