The core application is fully functional and includes everything you need to design & run link surveys, website surveys and in-app surveys. You can use the software for free for personal and commercial use. You're also allowed to create and distribute modified versions as long as you document the changes you make incl. date. The AGPL license requires you to publish your modified version under the AGPLv3 license as well.\n\n The Enterprise Edition\n\nAdditional to the AGPL licensed Formbricks core, this repository contains code licensed under an Enterprise license. The codehttps://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/tree/main/apps/web/modules/ee and licensehttps://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/main/apps/web/modules/ee/LICENSE for the enterprise functionality can be found in the /apps/web/modules/ee folder of this repository.

Any other needs? Send us an emailmailto:hola@formbricks.com.\n\n Why charge for Enterprise Features?\n\nThe Enterprise Edition allows us to fund the development of Formbricks sustainably.
