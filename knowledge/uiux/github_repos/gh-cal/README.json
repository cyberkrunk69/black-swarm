You are in charge\nof your own data, workflow, and appearance.\n\nCalendly and other scheduling tools are awesome. It made our lives massively easier. We're using it for business meetings, seminars, yoga classes, and even calls with our families. However, most tools are very limited in terms of control and customization.\n\nThat's where Cal.com comes in. Self-hosted or hosted by us. White-label by design. API-driven and ready to be deployed on your own domain. Full control of your events and data.\n\n Recognition\n\n Hacker Newshttps://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=cal.com\n\n<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34507672\">\n  <img\n    style=\"width: 250px; height: 54px;\" width=\"250\" height=\"54\"\n    alt=\"Featured on Hacker News\"\n    src=\"https://hackernews-badge.vercel.app/api?id=34507672\"\n  />\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26817795\">\n  <img\n    style=\"width: 250px; height: 54px;\" width=\"250\" height=\"54\"\n    alt=\"Featured on Hacker News\"\n    src=\"https://hackernews-badge.vercel.app/api?id=26817795\"\n  />\n</a>\n\n Product Hunthttps://producthunt.com/products/cal-com?utm_source=badge-top-post-badge&utm_medium=badge\n\n<a href=\"https://producthunt.com/posts/calendso?utm_source=badge-top-post-badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_souce=badge-calendso\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://api.producthunt.com/widgets/embed-image/v1/top-post-badge.svg?post_id=291910&theme=light&period=monthly\" alt=\"Cal.com - The open source Calendly alternative | Product Hunt\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 54px;\" width=\"250\" height=\"54\" /></a> <a href=\"https://producthunt.com/posts/calendso?utm_source=badge-featured&utm_medium=badge&utm_souce=badge-calendso\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://api.producthunt.com/widgets/embed-image/v1/featured.svg?post_id=291910&theme=light\" alt=\"Cal.com - The open source Calendly alternative | Product Hunt\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 54px;\" width=\"250\" height=\"54\" /></a> <a href=\"https://producthunt.com/stories/how-this-open-source-calendly-alternative-rocketed-to-product-of-the-day\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://cal.com/maker-grant.svg\" alt=\"Cal.com - The open source Calendly alternative | Product Hunt\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 54px;\" width=\"250\" height=\"54\" /></a>\n\nThis project is tested with browserstack\n\n Built With\n\n- Next.jshttps://nextjs.org/?ref=cal.com\n- tRPChttps://trpc.io/?ref=cal.com\n- React.jshttps://reactjs.org/?ref=cal.com\n- Tailwind CSShttps://tailwindcss.com/?ref=cal.com\n- Prisma.iohttps://prisma.io/?ref=cal.com\n- Daily.cohttps://go.cal.com/daily\n\n Contact us\n\nMeet our sales team for any commercial inquiries.\n\n<a href=\"https://cal.com/sales\"><img src=\"https://cal.com/book-with-cal-dark.svg\" alt=\"Book us with Cal.com\"></a>\n\n Stay Up-to-Date\n\nCal.com officially launched as v.1.0 on the 15th of September 2021 and we've come a long way so far.

More details on this can be found below under the integrations sectionintegrations.\n\n Development\n\n Setup\n\n1. Clone the repo or fork https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/fork. The code is licensed under AGPLv3https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/blob/main/LICENSE, which requires you to provide source code to users who interact with the software over a network. For commercial use without these requirements, acquire a commercial licensehttps://cal.com/sales\n\n   sh\n   git clone https://github.com/calcom/cal.com.git\n   \n\n   > If you are on Windows, run the following command on gitbash with admin privileges: <br> > git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/calcom/cal.com.git <br>\n   > See docshttps://cal.com/docs/how-to-guides/how-to-troubleshoot-symbolic-link-issues-on-windowsenable-symbolic-links for more details.\n\n2. Go to the project folder\n\n   sh\n   cd cal.com\n   \n\n3. Install packages with yarn\n\n   sh\n   yarn\n   \n\n4. Set up your .env file\n\n   - Duplicate .env.example to .env\n   - Use openssl rand -base64 32 to generate a key and add it under NEXTAUTH_SECRET in the .env file.\n   - Use openssl rand -base64 24 to generate a key and add it under CALENDSO_ENCRYPTION_KEY in the .env file.\n\n5. Setup Node\n   If your Node version does not meet the project's requirements as instructed by the docs, \"nvm\" Node Version Manager allows using Node at the version required by the project:\n\n   sh\n   nvm use\n   \n\n   You first might need to install the specific version and then use it:\n\n   sh\n   nvm install && nvm use\n   \n\n   You can install nvm from herehttps://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm.\n\n Quick start with yarn dx\n\n> - Requires Docker and Docker Compose to be installed\n> - Will start a local Postgres instance with a few test users - the credentials will be logged in the console\n\nsh\nyarn dx\n\nDefault credentials created:\n\n| Email | Password | Role |\n|-------|----------|------|\n| free@example.com | free | Free user |\n| pro@example.com | pro | Pro user |\n| trial@example.com | trial | Trial user |\n| admin@example.com | ADMINadmin2022! | Admin user |\n| onboarding@example.com | onboarding | Onboarding incomplete |\n\nYou can use any of these credentials to sign in at http://localhost:3000http://localhost:3000\n\n> Tip: To view the full list of seeded users and their details, run yarn db-studio and visit http://localhost:5555http://localhost:5555\n\n Development tip\n\n1. Add export NODE_OPTIONS=\u201c--max-old-space-size=16384\u201d to your shell script to increase the memory limit for the node process. Alternatively, you can run this in your terminal before running the app. Replace 16384 with the amount of RAM you want to allocate to the node process.\n\n2. Add NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL={level} to your .env file to control the logging verbosity for all tRPC queries and mutations.\\\n   Where {level} can be one of the following:\n\n   0 for silly \\\n   1 for trace \\\n   2 for debug \\\n   3 for info \\\n   4 for warn \\\n   5 for error \\\n   6 for fatal\n\n   When you set NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL={level} in your .env file, it enables logging at that level and higher. Here's how it works:\n\n   The logger will include all logs that are at the specified level or higher. For example: \\\n\n   - If you set NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL=2, it will log from level 2 debug upwards, meaning levels 2 debug, 3 info, 4 warn, 5 error, and 6 fatal will be logged. \\\n   - If you set NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL=3, it will log from level 3 info upwards, meaning levels 3 info, 4 warn, 5 error, and 6 fatal will be logged, but level 2 debug and level 1 trace will be ignored. \\\n\nsh\necho 'NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL=3' >> .env\n\nfor Logger level to be set at info, for example.\n\n Gitpod Setup\n\n1. Click the button below to open this project in Gitpod.\n\n2. This will open a fully configured workspace in your browser with all the necessary dependencies already installed.\n\n!Open in Gitpodhttps://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svghttps://gitpod.io/https://github.com/calcom/cal.com\n\n Manual setup\n\n1. Configure environment variables in the .env file. Replace <user>, <pass>, <db-host>, and <db-port> with their applicable values\n\n   \n   DATABASE_URL='postgresql://<user>:<pass>@<db-host>:<db-port>'\n   \n\n   <details>\n   <summary>If you don't know how to configure the DATABASE_URL, then follow the steps here to create a quick local DB</summary>\n\n   1. Downloadhttps://www.postgresql.org/download/ and install postgres in your local if you don't have it already.\n\n   2. Create your own local db by executing createDB <DB name>\n\n   3. Now open your psql shell with the DB you created: psql -h localhost -U postgres -d <DB name>\n\n   4. Inside the psql shell execute \\conninfo. And you will get the following info.\n      !imagehttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39329182/236612291-51d87f69-6dc1-4a23-bf4d-1ca1754e0a35.png\n\n   5. Now extract all the info and add it to your DATABASE_URL. The url would look something like this\n      postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/Your-DB-Name. The port is configurable and does not have to be 5432.\n\n   </details>\n\n   If you don't want to create a local DB. Then you can also consider using services like railway.app, Northflank or render.\n\n   - Setup postgres DB with railway.apphttps://docs.railway.app/guides/postgresql\n   - Setup postgres DB with Northflankhttps://northflank.com/guides/deploy-postgres-database-on-northflank\n   - Setup postgres DB with renderhttps://render.com/docs/databases\n\n2. Copy and paste your DATABASE_URL from .env to .env.appStore.\n\n3. Set up the database using the Prisma schema found in packages/prisma/schema.prisma\n\n   In a development environment, run:\n\n   sh\n   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-migrate\n   \n\n   In a production environment, run:\n\n   sh\n   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-deploy\n   \n\n4. Run mailhoghttps://github.com/mailhog/MailHog to view emails sent during development\n\n   > _NOTE:_ Required when E2E_TEST_MAILHOG_ENABLED is \"1\"\n\n   sh\n   docker pull mailhog/mailhog\n   docker run -d -p 8025:8025 -p 1025:1025 mailhog/mailhog\n   \n\n5. Run in development mode\n\n   sh\n   yarn dev\n   \n\n Setting up your first user\n\n Approach 1\n\n1. Open Prisma Studiohttps://prisma.io/studio to look at or modify the database content:\n\n   sh\n   yarn db-studio\n   \n\n1. Click on the User model to add a new user record.\n1. Fill out the fields email, username, password, and set metadata to empty {} remembering to encrypt your password with BCrypthttps://bcrypt-generator.com/ and click Save 1 Record to create your first user.\n   > New users are set on a TRIAL plan by default. You might want to adjust this behavior to your needs in the packages/prisma/schema.prisma file.\n1. Open a browser to http://localhost:3000http://localhost:3000 and login with your just created, first user.\n\n Approach 2\n\nSeed the local db by running\n\nsh\ncd packages/prisma\nyarn db-seed\n\nThe above command will populate the local db with dummy users.\n\n E2E-Testing\n\nBe sure to set the environment variable NEXTAUTH_URL to the correct value. If you are running locally, as the documentation within .env.example mentions, the value should be http://localhost:3000.\n\nsh\n In a terminal just run:\nyarn test-e2e\n\n To open the last HTML report run:\nyarn playwright show-report test-results/reports/playwright-html-report\n\n Resolving issues\n\n E2E test browsers not installed\n\nRun npx playwright install to download test browsers and resolve the error below when running yarn test-e2e:\n\nExecutable doesn't exist at /Users/alice/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/chromium-1048/chrome-mac/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium\n\n Upgrading from earlier versions\n\n1. Pull the current version:\n\n   sh\n   git pull\n   \n\n1. Check if dependencies got added/updated/removed\n\n   sh\n   yarn\n   \n\n1. Apply database migrations by running <b>one of</b> the following commands:\n\n   In a development environment, run:\n\n   sh\n   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-migrate\n   \n\n   This can clear your development database in some cases\n\n   In a production environment, run:\n\n   sh\n   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-deploy\n   \n\n1. Check for .env variables changes\n\n   sh\n   yarn predev\n   \n\n1. Start the server. In a development environment, just do:\n\n   sh\n   yarn dev\n   \n\n   For a production build, run for example:\n\n   sh\n   yarn build\n   yarn start\n   \n\n1. Enjoy the new version.\n<!-- DEPLOYMENT -->\n\n Deployment\n\n Docker\n\nOfficial support: Our team will begin to officially support the Dockerfile and docker-compose resources in this\nrepository.\n\nImportant: Cal.com will not be supporting installations that use these Docker resources. While we provide and maintain the Docker configurations, support for Docker-based installations is the responsibility of the user.\n\nThis image can be found on DockerHub at https://hub.docker.com/r/calcom/cal.comhttps://hub.docker.com/r/calcom/cal.com.\n\nNote for ARM Users: Use the {version}-arm suffix for pulling images. Example: docker pull calcom/cal.com:v5.6.19-arm.\n\n Requirements\n\nMake sure you have docker & docker compose installed on the server / system. Both are installed by most docker utilities, including Docker Desktop and Rancher Desktop.\n\nNote: docker compose without the hyphen is now the primary method of using docker-compose, per the Docker documentation.\n\n Most users Running Cal.com with Docker Compose\n\nIf you are evaluating Cal.com or running with minimal to no modifications, this option is for you.\n\n1. Clone calcom/cal.com\n\n   bash\n   git clone --recursive https://github.com/calcom/cal.com.git\n   \n\n2. Change into the directory\n\n   bash\n   cd cal.com\n   \n\n3. Prepare your configuration: Rename .env.example to .env and then update .env\n\n   bash\n   cp .env.example .env\n   \n\n   Most configurations can be left as-is, but for configuration options see Important Run-time variablesimportant-run-time-variables below.\n\n   Push Notifications VAPID Keys\n   If you see an error like:\n\n   \n   Error: No key set vapidDetails.publicKey\n   \n\n   This means your environment variables for Web Push are missing.\n   You must generate and set NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY and VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY.\n\n   Generate them with:\n\n   bash\n   npx web-push generate-vapid-keys\n   \n\n   Then update your .env file:\n\n   env\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here\n   VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here\n   \n\n   Do not commit real keys to .env.example \u2014 only placeholders.\n\n   Update the appropriate values in your .env file, then proceed.\n\n4. optional Pre-Pull the images by running the following command:\n\n   bash\n   docker compose pull\n   \n\n   This will use the default image locations as specified by image: in the docker-compose.yaml file.\n\n   Note: To aid with support, by default Scarf.sh is used as registry proxy for download metrics.\n\n5. Start Cal.com via docker compose\n\n   Most basic users, and for First Run To run the complete stack, which includes a local Postgres database, Cal.com web app, and Prisma Studio:\n\n   bash\n   docker compose up -d\n   \n\n   To run Cal.com web app and Prisma Studio against a remote database, ensure that DATABASE_URL is configured for an available database and run:\n\n   bash\n   docker compose up -d calcom studio\n   \n\n   To run only the Cal.com web app, ensure that DATABASE_URL is configured for an available database and run:\n\n   bash\n   docker compose up -d calcom\n   \n\n   Note: to run in attached mode for debugging, remove -d from your desired run command.\n\n6. Open a browser to http://localhost:3000http://localhost:3000, or your defined NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL. The first time you run Cal.com, a setup wizard will initialize. Define your first user, and you're ready to go!\n\n Updating Cal.com\n\n1. Stop the Cal.com stack\n\n   bash\n   docker compose down\n   \n\n2. Pull the latest changes\n\n   bash\n   docker compose pull\n   \n\n3. Update env vars as necessary.\n4. Re-start the Cal.com stack\n\n   bash\n   docker compose up -d\n   \n\n Advanced users Build and Run Cal.com\n\n1. Clone calcom/docker.\n\n   bash\n   git clone https://github.com/calcom/cal.com.git calcom-docker\n   \n\n2. Change into the directory\n\n   bash\n   cd calcom-docker\n   \n\n3. Update the calcom submodule. This project depends on the Cal.com source code, which is included here as a Git submodule. To make sure you get everything you need, update the submodule with the command below.\n\n   bash\n   git submodule update --remote --init\n   \n\n   Note: DO NOT use recursive submodule update, otherwise you will receive a git authentication error.\n\n4. Rename .env.example to .env and then update .env\n\n   For configuration options see Build-time variablesbuild-time-variables below. Update the appropriate values in your .env file, then proceed.\n\n5. Build the Cal.com docker image:\n\n   Note: Due to application configuration requirements, an available database is currently required during the build process.\n\n   a If hosting elsewhere, configure the DATABASE_URL in the .env file, and skip the next step\n\n   b If a local or temporary database is required, start a local database via docker compose.\n\n   bash\n   docker compose up -d database\n   \n\n6. Build Cal.com via docker compose DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 must be provided to allow a network bridge to be used at build time. This requirement will be removed in the future\n\n   bash\n   DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 docker compose build calcom\n   \n\n7. Start Cal.com via docker compose\n\n   Most basic users, and for First Run To run the complete stack, which includes a local Postgres database, Cal.com web app, and Prisma Studio:\n\n   bash\n   docker compose up -d\n   \n\n   To run Cal.com web app and Prisma Studio against a remote database, ensure that DATABASE_URL is configured for an available database and run:\n\n   bash\n   docker compose up -d calcom studio\n   \n\n   To run only the Cal.com web app, ensure that DATABASE_URL is configured for an available database and run:\n\n   bash\n   docker compose up -d calcom\n   \n\n   Note: to run in attached mode for debugging, remove -d from your desired run command.\n\n8. Open a browser to http://localhost:3000http://localhost:3000, or your defined NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL. The first time you run Cal.com, a setup wizard will initialize.

Only do this if you know what you are doing and trust the services/load-balancers directing traffic to your service.\n\n Failed to commit changes: Invalid 'prisma.user.create'\n\nCertain versions may have trouble creating a user if the field metadata is empty. Using an empty json object {} as the field value should resolve this issue. Also, the id field will autoincrement, so you may also try leaving the value of id as empty.\n\n CLIENT_FETCH_ERROR\n\nIf you experience this error, it may be the way the default Auth callback in the server is using the WEBAPP_URL as a base url. The container does not necessarily have access to the same DNS as your local machine, and therefor needs to be configured to resolve to itself. You may be able to correct this by configuring NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/auth, to help the backend loop back to itself.\n\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start: next-autherrorCLIENT_FETCH_ERROR\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start: https://next-auth.js.org/errorsclient_fetch_error request to http://testing.localhost:3000/api/auth/session failed, reason: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND testing.localhost {\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:   error: {\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:     message: 'request to http://testing.localhost:3000/api/auth/session failed, reason: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND testing.localhost',\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:     stack: 'FetchError: request to http://testing.localhost:3000/api/auth/session failed, reason: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND testing.localhost\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at ClientRequest.<anonymous> /calcom/node_modules/next/dist/compiled/node-fetch/index.js:1:65756\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at ClientRequest.emit node:events:513:28\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at ClientRequest.emit node:domain:489:12\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at Socket.socketErrorListener node:_http_client:494:9\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at Socket.emit node:events:513:28\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at Socket.emit node:domain:489:12\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at emitErrorNT node:internal/streams/destroy:157:8\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at emitErrorCloseNT node:internal/streams/destroy:122:3\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at processTicksAndRejections node:internal/process/task_queues:83:21',\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:     name: 'FetchError'\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:   },\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:   url: 'http://testing.localhost:3000/api/auth/session',\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:   message: 'request to http://testing.localhost:3000/api/auth/session failed, reason: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND testing.localhost'\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start: }\n\n<img referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\" src=\"https://static.scarf.sh/a.png?x-pxid=81cda9f7-a102-453b-ac01-51c35650bd70\" />\n\n Railway\n\n!Deploy on Railwayhttps://railway.app/button.svghttps://railway.app/new/template/cal\n\nYou can deploy Cal.com on Railwayhttps://railway.app using the button above.

You are in charge\nof your own data, workflow, and appearance.\n\nCalendly and other scheduling tools are awesome. It made our lives massively easier. We're using it for business meetings, seminars, yoga classes, and even calls with our families. However, most tools are very limited in terms of control and customization.\n\nThat's where Cal.com comes in. Self-hosted or hosted by us. White-label by design. API-driven and ready to be deployed on your own domain.

Watch **releases** of this repository to be notified of future updates:\n\n![cal-star-github](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8019099/154853944-a9e3c999-3da3-4048-b149-b4f73893c6fb.gif)\n\n<!-- GETTING STARTED -->\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo get a local copy up and running, please follow these simple steps.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nHere is what you need to be able to run Cal.com.\n\n- Node.js (Version: >=18.x)\n- PostgreSQL (Version: >=13.x)\n- Yarn _(recommended)_\n\n> If you want to enable any of the available integrations, you may want to obtain additional credentials for each one. More details on this can be found below under the [integrations section](#integrations).\n\n## Development\n\n### Setup\n\n1. Clone the repo (or fork https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/fork). The code is licensed under [AGPLv3](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/blob/main/LICENSE), which requires you to provide source code to users who interact with the software over a network. For commercial use without these requirements, [acquire a commercial license](https://cal.com/sales)\n\n   ```sh\n   git clone https://github.com/calcom/cal.com.git\n   ```\n\n   > If you are on Windows, run the following command on `gitbash` with admin privileges: <br> > `git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/calcom/cal.com.git` <br>\n   > See [docs](https://cal.com/docs/how-to-guides/how-to-troubleshoot-symbolic-link-issues-on-windows#enable-symbolic-links) for more details.\n\n2. Go to the project folder\n\n   ```sh\n   cd cal.com\n   ```\n\n3. Install packages with yarn\n\n   ```sh\n   yarn\n   ```\n\n4. Set up your `.env` file\n\n   - Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env`\n   - Use `openssl rand -base64 32` to generate a key and add it under `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` in the `.env` file.\n   - Use `openssl rand -base64 24` to generate a key and add it under `CALENDSO_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in the `.env` file.\n\n5. Setup Node\n   If your Node version does not meet the project's requirements as instructed by the docs, \"nvm\" (Node Version Manager) allows using Node at the version required by the project:\n\n   ```sh\n   nvm use\n   ```\n\n   You first might need to install the specific version and then use it:\n\n   ```sh\n   nvm install && nvm use\n   ```\n\n   You can install nvm from [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).\n\n#### Quick start with `yarn dx`\n\n> - **Requires Docker and Docker Compose to be installed**\n> - Will start a local Postgres instance with a few test users - the credentials will be logged in the console\n\n```sh\nyarn dx\n```\n\n**Default credentials created:**\n\n| Email | Password | Role |\n|-------|----------|------|\n| `free@example.com` | `free` | Free user |\n| `pro@example.com` | `pro` | Pro user |\n| `trial@example.com` | `trial` | Trial user |\n| `admin@example.com` | `ADMINadmin2022!` | Admin user |\n| `onboarding@example.com` | `onboarding` | Onboarding incomplete |\n\nYou can use any of these credentials to sign in at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)\n\n> **Tip**: To view the full list of seeded users and their details, run `yarn db-studio` and visit [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555)\n\n#### Development tip\n\n1. Add `export NODE_OPTIONS=\u201c--max-old-space-size=16384\u201d` to your shell script to increase the memory limit for the node process. Alternatively, you can run this in your terminal before running the app. Replace 16384 with the amount of RAM you want to allocate to the node process.\n\n2. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL={level}` to your .env file to control the logging verbosity for all tRPC queries and mutations.\\\n   Where {level} can be one of the following:\n\n   `0` for silly \\\n   `1` for trace \\\n   `2` for debug \\\n   `3` for info \\\n   `4` for warn \\\n   `5` for error \\\n   `6` for fatal\n\n   When you set `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL={level}` in your .env file, it enables logging at that level and higher. Here's how it works:\n\n   The logger will include all logs that are at the specified level or higher. For example: \\\n\n   - If you set `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL=2`, it will log from level 2 (debug) upwards, meaning levels 2 (debug), 3 (info), 4 (warn), 5 (error), and 6 (fatal) will be logged. \\\n   - If you set `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL=3`, it will log from level 3 (info) upwards, meaning levels 3 (info), 4 (warn), 5 (error), and 6 (fatal) will be logged, but level 2 (debug) and level 1 (trace) will be ignored. \\\n\n```sh\necho 'NEXT_PUBLIC_LOGGER_LEVEL=3' >> .env\n```\n\nfor Logger level to be set at info, for example.\n\n#### Gitpod Setup\n\n1. Click the button below to open this project in Gitpod.\n\n2. This will open a fully configured workspace in your browser with all the necessary dependencies already installed.\n\n[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/calcom/cal.com)\n\n#### Manual setup\n\n1. Configure environment variables in the `.env` file. Replace `<user>`, `<pass>`, `<db-host>`, and `<db-port>` with their applicable values\n\n   ```\n   DATABASE_URL='postgresql://<user>:<pass>@<db-host>:<db-port>'\n   ```\n\n   <details>\n   <summary>If you don't know how to configure the DATABASE_URL, then follow the steps here to create a quick local DB</summary>\n\n   1. [Download](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and install postgres in your local (if you don't have it already).\n\n   2. Create your own local db by executing `createDB <DB name>`\n\n   3. Now open your psql shell with the DB you created: `psql -h localhost -U postgres -d <DB name>`\n\n   4. Inside the psql shell execute `\\conninfo`. And you will get the following info.\n      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39329182/236612291-51d87f69-6dc1-4a23-bf4d-1ca1754e0a35.png)\n\n   5. Now extract all the info and add it to your DATABASE_URL. The url would look something like this\n      `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/Your-DB-Name`. The port is configurable and does not have to be 5432.\n\n   </details>\n\n   If you don't want to create a local DB. Then you can also consider using services like railway.app, Northflank or render.\n\n   - [Setup postgres DB with railway.app](https://docs.railway.app/guides/postgresql)\n   - [Setup postgres DB with Northflank](https://northflank.com/guides/deploy-postgres-database-on-northflank)\n   - [Setup postgres DB with render](https://render.com/docs/databases)\n\n2. Copy and paste your `DATABASE_URL` from `.env` to `.env.appStore`.\n\n3. Set up the database using the Prisma schema (found in `packages/prisma/schema.prisma`)\n\n   In a development environment, run:\n\n   ```sh\n   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-migrate\n   ```\n\n   In a production environment, run:\n\n   ```sh\n   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-deploy\n   ```\n\n4. Run [mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) to view emails sent during development\n\n   > **_NOTE:_** Required when `E2E_TEST_MAILHOG_ENABLED` is \"1\"\n\n   ```sh\n   docker pull mailhog/mailhog\n   docker run -d -p 8025:8025 -p 1025:1025 mailhog/mailhog\n   ```\n\n5. Run (in development mode)\n\n   ```sh\n   yarn dev\n   ```\n\n#### Setting up your first user\n\n##### Approach 1\n\n1. Open [Prisma Studio](https://prisma.io/studio) to look at or modify the database content:\n\n   ```sh\n   yarn db-studio\n   ```\n\n1. Click on the `User` model to add a new user record.\n1. Fill out the fields `email`, `username`, `password`, and set `metadata` to empty `{}` (remembering to encrypt your password with [BCrypt](https://bcrypt-generator.com/)) and click `Save 1 Record` to create your first user.\n   > New users are set on a `TRIAL` plan by default. You might want to adjust this behavior to your needs in the `packages/prisma/schema.prisma` file.\n1. Open a browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and login with your just created, first user.\n\n##### Approach 2\n\nSeed the local db by running\n\n```sh\ncd packages/prisma\nyarn db-seed\n```\n\nThe above command will populate the local db with dummy users.\n\n### E2E-Testing\n\nBe sure to set the environment variable `NEXTAUTH_URL` to the correct value. If you are running locally, as the documentation within `.env.example` mentions, the value should be `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n```sh\n# In a terminal just run:\nyarn test-e2e\n\n# To open the last HTML report run:\nyarn playwright show-report test-results/reports/playwright-html-report\n```\n\n#### Resolving issues\n\n##### E2E test browsers not installed\n\nRun `npx playwright install` to download test browsers and resolve the error below when running `yarn test-e2e`:\n\n```\nExecutable doesn't exist at /Users/alice/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/chromium-1048/chrome-mac/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium\n```\n\n### Upgrading from earlier versions\n\n1. Pull the current version:\n\n   ```sh\n   git pull\n   ```\n\n1. Check if dependencies got added/updated/removed\n\n   ```sh\n   yarn\n   ```\n\n1. Apply database migrations by running <b>one of</b> the following commands:\n\n   In a development environment, run:\n\n   ```sh\n   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-migrate\n   ```\n\n   (This can clear your development database in some cases)\n\n   In a production environment, run:\n\n   ```sh\n   yarn workspace @calcom/prisma db-deploy\n   ```\n\n1. Check for `.env` variables changes\n\n   ```sh\n   yarn predev\n   ```\n\n1. Start the server. In a development environment, just do:\n\n   ```sh\n   yarn dev\n   ```\n\n   For a production build, run for example:\n\n   ```sh\n   yarn build\n   yarn start\n   ```\n\n1. Enjoy the new version.\n<!-- DEPLOYMENT -->\n\n## Deployment\n\n### Docker\n\n**Official support**: Our team will begin to officially support the Dockerfile and docker-compose resources in this\nrepository.\n\n**Important**: Cal.com will **not** be supporting installations that use these Docker resources. While we provide and maintain the Docker configurations, support for Docker-based installations is the responsibility of the user.\n\nThis image can be found on DockerHub at [https://hub.docker.com/r/calcom/cal.com](https://hub.docker.com/r/calcom/cal.com).\n\n**Note for ARM Users**: Use the {version}-arm suffix for pulling images. Example: `docker pull calcom/cal.com:v5.6.19-arm`.\n\n#### Requirements\n\nMake sure you have `docker` & `docker compose` installed on the server / system. Both are installed by most docker utilities, including Docker Desktop and Rancher Desktop.\n\nNote: `docker compose` without the hyphen is now the primary method of using docker-compose, per the Docker documentation.\n\n#### (Most users) Running Cal.com with Docker Compose\n\nIf you are evaluating Cal.com or running with minimal to no modifications, this option is for you.\n\n1. Clone calcom/cal.com\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone --recursive https://github.com/calcom/cal.com.git\n   ```\n\n2. Change into the directory\n\n   ```bash\n   cd cal.com\n   ```\n\n3. Prepare your configuration: Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and then update `.env`\n\n   ```bash\n   cp .env.example .env\n   ```\n\n   Most configurations can be left as-is, but for configuration options see [Important Run-time variables](#important-run-time-variables) below.\n\n   **Push Notifications (VAPID Keys)**\n   If you see an error like:\n\n   ```\n   Error: No key set vapidDetails.publicKey\n   ```\n\n   This means your environment variables for Web Push are missing.\n   You must generate and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` and `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`.\n\n   Generate them with:\n\n   ```bash\n   npx web-push generate-vapid-keys\n   ```\n\n   Then update your `.env` file:\n\n   ```env\n   NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here\n   VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here\n   ```\n\n   Do **not** commit real keys to `.env.example` \u2014 only placeholders.\n\n   Update the appropriate values in your .env file, then proceed.\n\n4. (optional) Pre-Pull the images by running the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   docker compose pull\n   ```\n\n   This will use the default image locations as specified by `image:` in the docker-compose.yaml file.\n\n   Note: To aid with support, by default Scarf.sh is used as registry proxy for download metrics.\n\n5. Start Cal.com via docker compose\n\n   (Most basic users, and for First Run) To run the complete stack, which includes a local Postgres database, Cal.com web app, and Prisma Studio:\n\n   ```bash\n   docker compose up -d\n   ```\n\n   To run Cal.com web app and Prisma Studio against a remote database, ensure that DATABASE_URL is configured for an available database and run:\n\n   ```bash\n   docker compose up -d calcom studio\n   ```\n\n   To run only the Cal.com web app, ensure that DATABASE_URL is configured for an available database and run:\n\n   ```bash\n   docker compose up -d calcom\n   ```\n\n   **Note: to run in attached mode for debugging, remove `-d` from your desired run command.**\n\n6. Open a browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), or your defined NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL. The first time you run Cal.com, a setup wizard will initialize. Define your first user, and you're ready to go!\n\n#### Updating Cal.com\n\n1. Stop the Cal.com stack\n\n   ```bash\n   docker compose down\n   ```\n\n2. Pull the latest changes\n\n   ```bash\n   docker compose pull\n   ```\n\n3. Update env vars as necessary.\n4. Re-start the Cal.com stack\n\n   ```bash\n   docker compose up -d\n   ```\n\n#### (Advanced users) Build and Run Cal.com\n\n1. Clone calcom/docker.\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/calcom/cal.com.git calcom-docker\n   ```\n\n2. Change into the directory\n\n   ```bash\n   cd calcom-docker\n   ```\n\n3. Update the calcom submodule. This project depends on the Cal.com source code, which is included here as a Git submodule. To make sure you get everything you need, update the submodule with the command below.\n\n   ```bash\n   git submodule update --remote --init\n   ```\n\n   Note: DO NOT use recursive submodule update, otherwise you will receive a git authentication error.\n\n4. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and then update `.env`\n\n   For configuration options see [Build-time variables](#build-time-variables) below. Update the appropriate values in your .env file, then proceed.\n\n5. Build the Cal.com docker image:\n\n   Note: Due to application configuration requirements, an available database is currently required during the build process.\n\n   a) If hosting elsewhere, configure the `DATABASE_URL` in the .env file, and skip the next step\n\n   b) If a local or temporary database is required, start a local database via docker compose.\n\n   ```bash\n   docker compose up -d database\n   ```\n\n6. Build Cal.com via docker compose (DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 must be provided to allow a network bridge to be used at build time. This requirement will be removed in the future)\n\n   ```bash\n   DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 docker compose build calcom\n   ```\n\n7. Start Cal.com via docker compose\n\n   (Most basic users, and for First Run) To run the complete stack, which includes a local Postgres database, Cal.com web app, and Prisma Studio:\n\n   ```bash\n   docker compose up -d\n   ```\n\n   To run Cal.com web app and Prisma Studio against a remote database, ensure that DATABASE_URL is configured for an available database and run:\n\n   ```bash\n   docker compose up -d calcom studio\n   ```\n\n   To run only the Cal.com web app, ensure that DATABASE_URL is configured for an available database and run:\n\n   ```bash\n   docker compose up -d calcom\n   ```\n\n   **Note: to run in attached mode for debugging, remove `-d` from your desired run command.**\n\n8. Open a browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), or your defined NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL. The first time you run Cal.com, a setup wizard will initialize. Define your first user, and you're ready to go!\n\n#### Configuration\n\n##### Important Run-time variables\n\nThese variables must also be provided at runtime\n\n| Variable                | Description                                                                                                                                                                      | Required | Default                                                             |\n| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| DATABASE_URL            | database url with credentials - if using a connection pooler, this setting should point there                                                                                    | required | `postgresql://unicorn_user:magical_password@database:5432/calendso` |\n| CALCOM_LICENSE_KEY      | Enterprise License Key                                                                                                                                                           | optional |                                                                     |\n| NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL  | Base URL of the site.

Currently, if you require changes to these variables, you must follow the instructions to build and publish your own image.\n\nUpdating these variables is not required for evaluation, but is required for running in production. Instructions for generating variables can be found in the [Cal.com instructions](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com)\n\n| Variable                               | Description                                                                                                                                | Required | Default                                                             |\n| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| DATABASE_URL                           | database url with credentials - if using a connection pooler, this setting should point there                                              | required | `postgresql://unicorn_user:magical_password@database:5432/calendso` |\n| MAX_OLD_SPACE_SIZE                     | Needed for Nodejs/NPM build options                                                                                                        | required | 4096                                                                |\n| NEXT_PUBLIC_LICENSE_CONSENT            | license consent - true/false                                                                                                               | required |                                                                     |\n| NEXTAUTH_SECRET                        | Cookie encryption key                                                                                                                      | required | `secret`                                                            |\n| CALENDSO_ENCRYPTION_KEY                | Authentication encryption key                                                                                                              | required | `secret`                                                            |\n| NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL                 | Base URL injected into static files                                                                                                        | optional | `http://localhost:3000`                                             |\n| NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSITE_TERMS_URL          | custom URL for terms and conditions website                                                                                                | optional | `https://cal.com/terms`                                             |\n| NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSITE_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL | custom URL for privacy policy website                                                                                                      | optional | `https://cal.com/privacy`                                           |\n| NEXT_PUBLIC_API_V2_URL                 | URL for the v2 API, only required for custom integrations or custom booking experiences using [Cal.com Platform](https://cal.com/platform) | optional |                                                                     |\n| CALCOM_TELEMETRY_DISABLED              | Allow Cal.com to collect anonymous usage data (set to `1` to disable)                                                                      | optional |                                                                     |\n| NEXT_PUBLIC_SINGLE_ORG_SLUG            | Required if ORGANIZATIONS_ENABLED is true                                                                                                  | optional |                                                                     |\n| ORGANIZATIONS_ENABLED                  | Used for Enterprise or Organizations plan                                                                                                  | optional |                                                                     |\n\n#### Troubleshooting\n\n##### SSL edge termination\n\nIf running behind a load balancer which handles SSL certificates, you will need to add the environmental variable `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` to prevent requests from being rejected. Only do this if you know what you are doing and trust the services/load-balancers directing traffic to your service.\n\n##### Failed to commit changes: Invalid 'prisma.user.create()'\n\nCertain versions may have trouble creating a user if the field `metadata` is empty. Using an empty json object `{}` as the field value should resolve this issue. Also, the `id` field will autoincrement, so you may also try leaving the value of `id` as empty.\n\n##### CLIENT_FETCH_ERROR\n\nIf you experience this error, it may be the way the default Auth callback in the server is using the WEBAPP_URL as a base url. The container does not necessarily have access to the same DNS as your local machine, and therefor needs to be configured to resolve to itself. You may be able to correct this by configuring `NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/auth`, to help the backend loop back to itself.\n\n```\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start: [next-auth][error][CLIENT_FETCH_ERROR]\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start: https://next-auth.js.org/errors#client_fetch_error request to http://testing.localhost:3000/api/auth/session failed, reason: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND testing.localhost {\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:   error: {\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:     message: 'request to http://testing.localhost:3000/api/auth/session failed, reason: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND testing.localhost',\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:     stack: 'FetchError: request to http://testing.localhost:3000/api/auth/session failed, reason: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND testing.localhost\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at ClientRequest.<anonymous> (/calcom/node_modules/next/dist/compiled/node-fetch/index.js:1:65756)\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at ClientRequest.emit (node:events:513:28)\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at ClientRequest.emit (node:domain:489:12)\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at Socket.socketErrorListener (node:_http_client:494:9)\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at Socket.emit (node:events:513:28)\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at Socket.emit (node:domain:489:12)\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at emitErrorNT (node:internal/streams/destroy:157:8)\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at emitErrorCloseNT (node:internal/streams/destroy:122:3)\\n' +\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:       '    at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:83:21)',\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:     name: 'FetchError'\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:   },\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:   url: 'http://testing.localhost:3000/api/auth/session',\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start:   message: 'request to http://testing.localhost:3000/api/auth/session failed, reason: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND testing.localhost'\ndocker-calcom-1  | @calcom/web:start: }\n```\n\n<img referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\" src=\"https://static.scarf.sh/a.png?x-pxid=81cda9f7-a102-453b-ac01-51c35650bd70\" />\n\n### Railway\n\n[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/new/template/cal)\n\nYou can deploy Cal.com on [Railway](https://railway.app) using the button above.
