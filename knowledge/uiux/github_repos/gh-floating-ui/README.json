Anchor positioning: Anchor a floating element such as a tooltip to\n   another element such as a button while simultaneously ensuring it stays in\n   view as best as possible by avoiding collisions. This feature is available\n   for all platforms.\n2. User interactions for React: Hooks and components for composing\n   interactions to create accessible floating UI components.\n\n README Contributors\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      <a href=\"https://milfordasset.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img width=\"176\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/floating-ui/floating-ui/blob/master/website/assets/sponsors/milford.svg\" alt=\"Milford\" /></a>\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      <a href=\"https://dopt.com/?utm_source=floating_ui_readme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img width=\"200\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/floating-ui/floating-ui/blob/master/website/assets/sponsors/dopt.png\" alt=\"Dopt\" /></a>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nYou can support Floating UI in a variety of ways on\nOpen Collectivehttps://opencollective.com/floating-ui.\n\n Why\n\nFloating elements are absolutely positioned, typically anchored to another UI\nelement. Ensuring a floating element remains anchored next to another element\ncan be challenging, especially in unique layout contexts like scrolling\ncontainers.\n\nAbsolute positioning can also cause problems when the floating element is too\nclose to the edge of the viewport and becomes obscured, also known as a\ncollision.
