For\nexample, say the user clicks a button to open a sidebar that slides over the screen, and you also need to fade-in a\nbackdrop at the same time.\n\nYou can do this by wrapping the related elements with a parent `Transition` component, and wrapping each child that\nneeds its own transition styles with a `TransitionChild` component, which will automatically communicate with the parent\n`Transition` and inherit the parent's `open` state.\n\n```\nimport { Transition, TransitionChild } from '@headlessui/react'\nimport { useState } from 'react'\n\nfunction Example() {\n  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>Open</button>\n      {/* The `show` prop controls all nested `TransitionChild` components. */}\n\n<Transition show={open}>\n\n        {/* Backdrop */}\n\n<TransitionChild>\n\n          <div\n            className=\"fixed inset-0 bg-black/30 transition duration-300 data-closed:opacity-0\"\n            onClick={() => setOpen(false)}\n          />\n\n</TransitionChild>\n\n        {/* Slide-in sidebar */}\n\n<TransitionChild>\n\n          <div className=\"fixed inset-y-0 left-0 w-64 bg-white transition duration-300 data-closed:-translate-x-full\">\n            {/* ... */}\n\n</div>\n\n</TransitionChild>\n\n      </Transition>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe `TransitionChild` component has the exact same API as the `Transition` component, but with no `show` prop, since the\n`show` value is controlled by the parent.\n\nParent `Transition` components will always automatically wait for all children to finish transitioning before\nunmounting, so you don't need to manage any of that timing yourself.\n\n### Transitioning on initial mount\n\nIf you want an element to transition the very first time it's rendered, set the `appear` prop to `true`.\n\nThis is useful if you want something to transition in on initial page load, or when its parent is conditionally\nrendered.\n\n```\nimport { Transition } from '@headlessui/react'\nimport { useState } from 'react'\n\nfunction Example() {\n  const [open, setOpen] = useState(true)\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setOpen((open) => !open)}>Toggle</button>\n\n<Transition show={open} appear={true}>\n\n        <div className=\"transition duration-300 ease-in data-closed:opacity-0\">I will fade in on initial render</div>\n      </Transition>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Component API\n\n### Transition\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Prop | Default | Description |\n| `as` | `Fragment` | `String | Component`  The element or component the transition should render as. |\n| `show` | \u2014 | `Boolean`  Whether the children should be shown or hidden. |\n| `appear` | `false` | `Boolean`  Whether the
