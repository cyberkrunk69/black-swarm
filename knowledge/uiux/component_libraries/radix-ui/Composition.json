When `asChild` is set to `true`, Radix will not render a default DOM element, instead cloning the part's child and passing it the props and behavior required to make it functional.\n\n## [Changing the element type](#changing-the-element-type)\n\nIn the majority of cases you shouldn\u2019t need to modify the element type as Radix has been designed to provide the most appropriate defaults. However, there are cases where it is helpful to do so.\n\nA good example is with `Tooltip.Trigger`. By default this part is rendered as a `button`, though you may want to add a tooltip to a link (`a` tag) as well. Let's see how you can achieve this using `asChild`:\n\n```\nimport * as React from \"react\";\n\nimport { Tooltip } from \"radix-ui\";\n\nexport default () => (\n\n<Tooltip.Root>\n\n<Tooltip.Trigger asChild>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.radix-ui.com/\">Radix UI</a>\n\n</Tooltip.Trigger>\n\n<Tooltip.Portal>\u2026</Tooltip.Portal>\n\n</Tooltip.Root>\n\n);\n```\n\n> If you do decide to change the underlying element type, it is your responsibility to ensure it remains accessible and functional. In the case of `Tooltip.Trigger` for example, it must be a focusable element that can respond to pointer and keyboard events. If you were to switch it to a `div`, it would no longer be accessible.\n\nIn reality, you will rarely modify the underlying DOM element like we've seen above.

If your component doesn't support those props, it will break.\n\nThis is done by spreading all of the props onto the underlying DOM node.\n\n```\n// before\n\nconst MyButton = () => <button />;\n\n// after\n\nconst MyButton = (props) => <button {...props} />;\n```\n\nWe recommend always doing this so that you are not concerned with implementation details (ie. which props/events to accept).

If your component doesn't accept a `ref`, then it will break.\n\nThis is done using `React.forwardRef` (read more on [react.dev](https://react.dev/reference/react/forwardRef)).\n\n```\n// before\n\nconst MyButton = (props) => <button {...props} />;\n\n// after\n\nconst MyButton = React.forwardRef((props, forwardedRef) => (\n\n<button {...props} ref={forwardedRef} />\n\n));\n```\n\nWhilst this isn't necessary for **all** parts, we recommend always doing it so that you are not concerned with implementation details. This is also generally good practice anyway for leaf components.\n\n## [Composing multiple primitives](#composing-multiple-primitives)\n\n`asChild` can be used as deeply as you need to. This means it is a great way to compose multiple primitive's behavior together.\nHere is an example of how you can compose `Tooltip.Trigger` and `Dialog.Trigger` together with your own button:\n\n```\nimport * as React from \"react\";\n\nimport { Dialog, Tooltip } from \"radix-ui\";\n\nconst MyButton = React.forwardRef((props, forwardedRef) => (\n\n<button {...props} ref={forwardedRef} />\n\n));\n\nexport default () => {\n\nreturn (\n\n<Dialog.Root>\n\n<Tooltip.Root>\n\n<Tooltip.Trigger asChild>\n\n<Dialog.Trigger asChild>\n\n<MyButton>Open dialog</MyButton>\n\n</Dialog.Trigger>\n\n</Tooltip.Trigger>\n\n<Tooltip.Portal>\u2026</Tooltip.Portal>\n\n</Tooltip.Root>\n\n<Dialog.Portal>...</Dialog.Portal>\n\n</Dialog.Root>\n\n);\n\n};\n```\n\nPrevious[Animation](/primitives/docs/guides/animation)\n\nNext[Server-side rendering](/primitives/docs/guides/server-side-rendering)\n\n[Edit this page on GitHub.](https://github.com/radix-ui/website/edit/main/data/primitives/docs/guides/composition.mdx \"Edit this page on GitHub.\")",
