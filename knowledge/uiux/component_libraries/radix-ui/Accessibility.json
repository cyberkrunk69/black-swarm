That means that users should be able to use our components as-is in most contexts and rely on functionality to follow the expected accessibility design patterns.\n\n## [WAI-ARIA](#wai-aria)\n\n[WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/), published and maintained by the W3C, specifies the semantics for many common UI patterns that show up in Radix Primitives. This is designed to provide meaning for controls that aren't built using elements provided by the browser. For example, if you use a `div` instead of a `button` element to create a button, there are attributes you need to add to the `div` in order to convey that it's a button for screen readers or voice recognition tools.\n\nIn addition to semantics, there are behaviors that are expected from different types of components. A `button` element is going to respond to certain interactions in ways that a `div` will not, so it's up to the developer to reimplement those interactions with JavaScript. The [WAI-ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/) provide additional guidance for implementing behaviors for various controls that come with Radix Primitives.\n\n## [Accessible Labels](#accessible-labels)\n\nWith many built-in form controls, the native HTML `label` element is designed to provide semantic meaning and context for corresponding `input` elements. For non-form control elements, or for custom controls like those provided by Radix Primitives, [WAI-ARIA provides a specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#namecalculation) for how to provide accessible names and descriptions to those controls.\n\nWhere possible, Radix Primitives include abstractions to make labelling our controls simple. The [`Label`](/primitives/docs/components/label) primitive is designed to work with many of our controls. Ultimately it's up to you to provide those labels so that users have the proper context when navigating your application.\n\n## [Keyboard Navigation](#keyboard-navigation)\n\nMany complex components, like [`Tabs`](/primitives/docs/components/tabs) and [`Dialog`](/primitives/docs/components/dialog), come with expectations from users on how to interact with their content using a keyboard or other non-mouse input modalities. Radix Primitives provide basic keyboard support in accordance with the [WAI-ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/).\n\n## [Focus Management](#focus-management)\n\nProper keyboard navigation and good labelling often go hand-in-hand with managing focus.

For example, in [`AlertDialog`](/primitives/docs/components/alert-dialog), when the modal is opened, focus is programmatically moved to a `Cancel` button element to anticipate a response to the prompt.\n\nPrevious[Getting started](/primitives/docs/overview/getting-started)\n\nNext[Releases](/primitives/docs/overview/releases)\n\n[Edit this page on GitHub.](https://github.com/radix-ui/website/edit/main/data/primitives/docs/overview/accessibility.mdx \"Edit this page on GitHub.\")",
