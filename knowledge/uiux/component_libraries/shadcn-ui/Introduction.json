Works with your favorite frameworks and AI models. Open Source. Open Code.\nThis is not a component library. It is how you build your component library.\nYou know how most traditional component libraries work: you install a package from NPM, import the components, and use them in your app.\nThis approach works well until you need to customize a component to fit your design system or require one that isn\u2019t included in the library.\nOften, you end up wrapping library components, writing workarounds to override styles, or mixing components from different libraries with incompatible APIs.\nThis is what shadcn/ui aims to solve. It is built around the following principles:\nOpen Code:\nThe top layer of your component code is open for modification.\nComposition:\nEvery component uses a common, composable interface, making them predictable.\nDistribution:\nA flat-file schema and command-line tool make it easy to distribute components.\nBeautiful Defaults:\nCarefully chosen default styles, so you get great design out-of-the-box.\nAI-Ready:\nOpen code for LLMs to read, understand, and improve.\nOpen Code\nshadcn/ui hands you the actual component code. You have full control to customize and extend the components to your needs. This means:\nFull Transparency:\nYou see exactly how each component is built.\nEasy Customization:\nModify any part of a component to fit your design and functionality requirements.\nAI Integration:\nAccess to the code makes it straightforward for LLMs to read, understand, and even improve your components.\nIn a typical library, if you need to change a button\u2019s behavior, you have to override styles or wrap the component. With shadcn/ui, you simply edit the button code directly.\nHow do I pull upstream updates in an Open Code approach?\nComposition\nEvery component in shadcn/ui shares a common, composable interface.\nIf a component does not exist, we bring it in, make it composable, and adjust its style to match and work with the rest of the design system.\nA shared, composable interface means it's predictable for both your team and LLMs. You are not learning different APIs for every new component. Even for third-party ones.\nDistribution\nshadcn/ui is also a code distribution system. It defines a schema for components and a CLI to distribute them.\nSchema:\nA flat-file structure that defines the components, their dependencies, and properties.\nCLI:\nA command-line tool to distribute and install components across projects with cross-framework support.\nYou can use the schema to distribute your components to other projects or have AI generate completely new components based on existing schema.\nBeautiful Defaults\nshadcn/ui comes with a large collection of components that have carefully chosen default styles. They are designed to look good on their own and to work well together as a consistent system:\nGood Out-of-the-Box:\nYour UI has a clean and minimal look without extra work.\nUnified Design:\nComponents naturally fit with one another. Each component is built to match the others, keeping your UI consistent.\nEasily Customizable:\nIf you want to change something, it's simple to override and extend the defaults.\nAI-Ready\nThe design of shadcn/ui makes it easy for AI tools to work with your code. Its open code and consistent API allow AI models to read, understand, and even generate new components.\nAn AI model can learn how your components work and suggest improvements or even create new components that integrate with your existing design.\nTypography\nInstallation\nOn This Page\nOpen Code\nComposition\nDistribution\nBeautiful Defaults\nAI-Ready\nDeploy your shadcn/ui app on Vercel\nTrusted by OpenAI, Sonos, Adobe, and more.\nVercel provides tools and infrastructure to deploy apps and features at scale.\nDeploy Now\nDeploy to Vercel",
