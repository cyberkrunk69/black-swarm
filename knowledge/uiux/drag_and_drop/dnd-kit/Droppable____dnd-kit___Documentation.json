Each droppable needs to have its own unique node though, so make sure you don't try to connect a single droppable to multiple refs.\nTo set up multiple droppable targets, simply use the\nuseDroppable\nhook as many times as needed.\nIf you need to dynamically render a list of droppable containers, we recommend you create a re-usable Droppable component and render that component as many times as needed:\nFor more details usage of the\nuseDroppable\nhook, refer to the API documentation section:\nuseDroppable\nLast updated\n5 years ago",
