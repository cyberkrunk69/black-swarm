Each icon is a fully-typed React component that renders as an optimized inline SVG, giving you the flexibility of components with the performance of vector graphics.\n\n**What you can accomplish:**\n\n- Import icons as React components with full TypeScript support\n- Pass props to customize size, color, stroke width, and other SVG attributes\n- Use icons in JSX with the same ease as any other React component\n- Benefit from automatic tree-shaking to include only the icons you use\n- Create dynamic icon components that respond to state and user interactions\n\n## Installation [\u200b](#installation)\n\npnpmyarnnpmbun\n\nsh\n\n```\npnpm add lucide-react\n```\n\nsh\n\n```\nyarn add lucide-react\n```\n\nsh\n\n```\nnpm install lucide-react\n```\n\nsh\n\n```\nbun add lucide-react\n```\n\n## How to use [\u200b](#how-to-use)\n\nLucide is built with ES Modules, so it's completely tree-shakable.\n\nEach icon can be imported as a React component, which renders an inline SVG element. This way, only the icons that are imported into your project are included in the final bundle. The rest of the icons are tree-shaken away.\n\n### Example [\u200b](#example)\n\nAdditional props can be passed to adjust the icon:\n\njsx\n\n```\nimport { Camera } from 'lucide-react';\n\n// Usage\nconst App = () => {\n  return <Camera color=\"red\" size={48} />;\n};\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\n## Props [\u200b](#props)\n\n| name | type | default |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `size` | *number* | 24 |\n| `color` | *string* | currentColor |\n| `strokeWidth` | *number* | 2 |\n| `absoluteStrokeWidth` | *boolean* | false |\n\n### Applying props [\u200b](#applying-props)\n\nTo customize the appearance of an icon, you can pass custom properties as props directly to the component. The component accepts all SVG attributes as props, which allows flexible styling of the SVG elements. See the list of SVG Presentation Attributes on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/Presentation).\n\njsx\n\n```\n// Usage\nconst App = () => {\n  return <Camera size={48} fill=\"red\" />;\n};\n```\n\n## With Lucide lab or custom icons [\u200b](#with-lucide-lab-or-custom-icons)\n\n[Lucide lab](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide-lab) is a collection of icons that are not part of the Lucide main library.\n\nThey can be used by using the `Icon` component. All props like regular lucide icons can be passed to adjust the icon appearance.\n\n### Using the `Icon` component [\u200b](#using-the-icon-component)\n\nThis creates a single icon based on the iconNode passed and renders a Lucide icon component.\n\njsx\n\n```\nimport { Icon } from 'lucide-react';\nimport { coconut } from '@lucide/lab';\n\nconst App = () => (\n  <Icon iconNode={coconut} />\n);\n```\n\n## Dynamic Icon Component [\u200b](#dynamic-icon-component)\n\nIt is possible to create one generic icon component to load icons. But it is not recommended, since it is importing all icons during the build. This increases build time and the different modules it will create.\n\n`DynamicIcon` is useful for applications that want to show icons dynamically by icon name. For example, when using a content management system with where icon names are stored in a database.\n\nFor static use cases, it is recommended to import the icons directly.\n\nThe same props can be passed to adjust the icon appearance. The `name` prop is required to load the correct icon.\n\njsx\n\n```\nimport { DynamicIcon } from 'lucide-react/dynamic';\n\nconst App = () => (\n  <DynamicIcon name=\"camera\" color=\"red\" size={48} />\n);\n```\n\n## Accessibility [\u200b](#accessibility)\n\nBy default, we hide icons from screen readers using `aria-hidden=\"true\"`.\n\nYou can add accessibility attributes using aria-labels.\n\njsx\n\n```\nimport { Check } from 'lucide-react';\n\nconst App = () => {\n  return <Check aria-label=\"Task completed\" />;\n};\n```\n\nFor best practices on accessibility, please see our [accessibility guide](./../advanced/accessibility).",
