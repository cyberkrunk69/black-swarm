Only marking optional fields makes it difficult for people to fill out the form.\nA common question in many of our\nUX Conference\nclasses is: should you mark the\nrequired\nfields in a form? If most fields in the form are required, should we still mark them? (That\u2019s a lot of marks, after all.) The short answer is\nyes\n. And I\u2019ll spend the rest of the article explaining why.\nIn This Article:\nThe Temptation to Not Mark the Required Fields\nHow to Mark the Required Fields?\nShould You Mark the Optional Fields, Too?\nHow About Login Forms?\nConclusion\nA Note on Accessibility\nThe Temptation to Not Mark the Required Fields\nOften designers feel that the having a marker for every single required field is repetitive, ugly, takes too much space, and, with longer forms, may even seem oppressive (the form requires so much from the user!).\u00a0 So, they usually adopt one or both of the following strategies:\nThey show instructions at the top of the form saying\nAll fields are required\nor\nAll fields are required unless otherwise indicated.\nThey mark the optional fields, since they are usually fewer.\n(In some rare situations, they don\u2019t do anything: they simply assume users will magically know what fields are required; if they don\u2019t, then they will just have to deal with the resulting error.)\nCiticards\u2019 credit-card application (left) included small-font italic instructions\nAll fields are required unless specified optional\nat the top of its form; American Express\u2019s form (right) had no instructions at all. In both forms, only optional fields were marked: in the case of Citibank with the somewhat unclear abbreviation\nopt\n.\nWhat\u2019s wrong with these approaches? There are a few problems:\nPeople don\u2019t read instructions at the top of forms.\nIt\u2019s well known that users don\u2019t read instructions, and they are particularly less likely to read instructions at the top of a form. Form fields seem self-sufficient \u2014 after all, each field has a specific instruction \u2014 its label, why would you need to read anything else to fill it in?\nEven if people read instructions, they may forget them.\nYou may think: if users read the instruction at the top, how could they forget it \u2014 it\u2019s such a simple thing? Well, they do forget \u2014 especially if the form is long or if they get interrupted while filling it out (a situation that is common on mobile). And even if people don\u2019t forget the instruction, you\u2019re increasing their\ncognitive load\nby having them commit it to their\nworking memory\n. In other words, you\u2019re making it harder for them to do their task. Filling in the form itself is quite challenging for your users \u2014 why would you want to make it even more so?\nPeople have to scan the form to determine if the field is required.\nWe\u2019ve seen that, whether you include instructions at the top of the form or not, the result is likely to be the same \u2014 people will ignore or forget them. So, what happens when the user fills out the form? How do they know whether a field is required? Well, the more-diligent users will look around trying to figure it out \u2014 they will scan the form and find a field that is marked\noptional\n(sometimes scrolling the page, like in the American Express example above, where the first optional field appears below the mobile fold); if they do find one, they will assume that anything not marked is required. But that takes time and\ninteraction cost\n\u2014 and, again, why would you make it harder for your users to fill in the form?\nMost users, however, will not bother to look around \u2014 they will simply make assumptions. They will say \u2013 \u201cWell, phone number \u2013 they don\u2019t really need my phone number, do they? Maybe I\u2019ll leave this blank\u201d. And even if they don\u2019t leave it blank, having to pause to decide whether a field needs to be completed slows down the interaction and makes the process seem longer and more tedious. (Remember, as much as you\u2019d like to think otherwise, nobody wants to fill out a form \u2014 whether on a small screen or on a large one.) The result will be a form-submission error, which will mean even more time spent addressing it.\nThe solution is simple:\nmark all the required fields\n. Be as explicit and transparent as possible: for every single field that must be completed, mark it as required.\nHow to Mark the Required Fields?\nThere are at least two options here: an asterisk (whether red or not) and the word \u201crequired\u201d.\nThe iOS Wallet app used the placeholder\nRequired\nto indicate the required fields. (In general, especially with longer forms, it\u2019s better to have the word\nRequired\noutside the field instead of inside it, to make it easy to identify the fields that still need to be filled in.)\nThe asterisk has become very common on the web and users are familiar with its meaning. Its main advantage is that it does not take up much space and looks different enough from the label text, so use it.\nShould the asterisk precede or follow the field label?\nThat is unlikely to make a practical difference, but one reason to put it just before the field description is to help the eyes easily locate which fields are required by scanning just the left-most character of the label.\nBoth these sites used the asterisk to mark required fields: UPS (left) displayed the asterisk at the end of the label and USPS (right) showed it at the beginning, in red. Showing it at the beginning in a different color makes it slightly easier to identify the required fields, which may prove useful when the form is longer. (However, we don\u2019t recommend using as small a font size as the one used for the USPS asterisk.)\nShould the asterisk be red?\nNot necessarily, but red has become the expected required-marker color on the web, which is a reason in its own right to stick with this choice (according to\nJakob\u2019s Law\n). In any case, there is some value to using different colors for the asterisk and for the field label: it allows users to quickly separate the two and focus on the field label while trying to decode what the field means. While red is somewhat recommended, we have a strong recommendation to\navoid pale grays or low-contrast colors\nfor the asterisk. Slightly muted colors can have aesthetic benefits, but truly low contrast symbols constitute an accessibility problem for low-vision or elderly users and slow down visual processing of the form for everybody.\nShould You Mark the Optional Fields, Too?\nWhile it\u2019s not obligatory,\nmarking the optional fields does lighten the user\u2019s cognitive load\n: in the absence of that word, the user must look around and infer that the field is optional based on the other fields being marked as required. If the word\noptional\nis next to the field descriptor, that task becomes a tad easier.\nNot specifying that a field is optional is not a deal breaker, but doing so is a nice perk.\nSephora\u2019s iOS app marked both the required and the optional fields.\nHow About Login Forms?\nLogin forms are short and traditionally composed of two fields: the username and the password, both of which are always required. If you\u2019re using the asterisk, the cost of marking these fields as required should be minimal, so you cannot go wrong. However, most users have encountered many, many login forms and they do know that to login you need to enter an email or username and a password. So, if you absolutely hate the asterisk, it\u2019s okay to leave it out in this type of form.\nUSPS\u2019s login form (left) marked the two fields as required. Kayak (right) did not mark them. Either design is acceptable for login forms.\nIt is, however, dangerous to not mark the required fields in a\nregistration\nform. Registration forms vary a lot across sites \u2014 different companies require different types of information when creating an account. If your registration form looks like a login form, it\u2019s safe to leave the required information out. But if it does include more than the username and the password fields, mark all required fields (including the username and password ones).\nSephora\u2019s registration form (on desktop) marked the required fields (included the email and password). (Unfortunately, the site violated other usability guidelines \u2014 in particular, it showed\nfield labels inside the fields\nand it had the\nSubscribe\ncheckbox automatically selected.)\nConclusion\nForms are no fun. They require users to do a lot of work. In fact, many forms end up being abandoned because filling them in is too hard or too tedious. To increase the chance that your form will get completed, minimize the effort that your users will have to put in and the information that they need to remember. There are many aspects that contribute to these, but marking the required fields (and, optionally, the optional ones) is an easy one to address.\nA Note on Accessibility\nAfter this article was published, we received a few questions about the accessibility of the asterisk as a required-field marker. In HTML 5, it is possible to\nadd markup to the form field to instruct screen readers to say the word \"required\"\nwhenever they encounter an asterisk next to the field label.\nRelated Courses\nWeb Page UX Design\nStrategically combine content, visuals, and interactive components to design successful web pages\nInteraction\nThe Human Mind and Usability\nUse psychology to predict and explain how your customers think and act\nInteraction\nforms,Web Usability\nRelated Topics\nWeb Usability\nWeb Usability\nLearn More:\nEnable cookies\nto watch NN/g videos\nMarking Required Fields in Online Forms\nRaluca Budiu\n\u00b7\n3 min\nSemantic Differential Scales: Measure User Attitudes with Nuance\nRachel Banawa\n\u00b7\n4 min\nCheckbox Design: 8 Guidelines\nMaddie Brown\n\u00b7\n3 min\nBetter Forms Through Visual Organization\nKathryn Whitenton\n\u00b7\n3 min\nRelated Articles:\nWebsite Forms Usability:  Top 10 Recommendations\nKathryn Whitenton\n\u00b7\n6 min\nReset and Cancel Buttons\nJakob Nielsen\n\u00b7\n5 min\nPlaceholders in Form Fields Are Harmful\nKatie Sherwin\n\u00b7\n6 min\nDate-Input Form Fields: UX Design Guidelines\nAngie Li\n\u00b7\n5 min\nPopups: 10 Problematic Trends and Alternatives\nAnna Kaley\n\u00b7\n12 min\nZigzag Image\u2013Text Layouts Make Scanning Less Efficient\nKim Flaherty\n\u00b7\n11 min",
