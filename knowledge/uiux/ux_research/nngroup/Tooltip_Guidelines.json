Although tooltips aren\u2019t new to the web, they are often incorrectly implemented.\nTooltips aren\u2019t new, but they\u2019re often misused.\nIn This Article:\nDefining Tooltips\nTooltips vs. Popup Tips\nTooltip-Usage Guidelines\nAdditional Recommendations\nConclusion\nDefining Tooltips\nDefinition: A\ntooltip\nis a brief, informative message that appears when a user interacts with an element in a graphical user interface (GUI). Tooltips are usually initiated in one of two ways: through a mouse-hover gesture or through a keyboard-hover gesture.\n(In case you\u2019re wondering what keyboard hover is: to access the active elements on a page, users can usually move the mouse to them or tab through them using the keyboard. Keyboard hover refers to maintaining the keyboard focus on the same element for a longer time.)\nTooltips can be attached to any active element (icons, text links, buttons, etc.) on a page. They provide descriptions or explanations for their paired element. Thus, tooltips are highly contextual and specific and don\u2019t explain the bigger picture or entire task flow.\nOne important aspect of tooltips is that they are user-triggered. Therefore, tips that pop up on pages to inform users about new features or\nhow to use a specific functionality\nare not tooltips.\nBecause tooltips are initiated by a hover gesture, they can be used only on devices with a mouse or keyboard. They are not normally available on touchscreens. (In the future, tooltips could be initiated on eyetracking-enabled devices when the user\u2019s gaze dwells on a GUI element for a certain duration.)\nTooltips vs. Popup Tips\nAlthough tooltips are mainly limited to desktop computers and laptops, they do have a sister element that is common on touchscreen devices: popup tips. Both tooltips and popup tips have the same goal: to provide helpful, additional content. The following table shows the key similarities and differences between popup tips and tooltips.\nTooltips\nPopup tips\nType of site\nDesktop\nAny\nInitiated by\nHover (mouse or keyboard)\nTouch/click\nTerminated when\nUser leaves predefined interaction area\nUser taps to close or clicks another area of the screen\nPaired element\nIcon, text link, button, image\n\u201c?\u201d or \u201ci\u201d icon\nContent type\nMicrocontent\nMicrocontent\nThis article will focus on tooltips and their use on desktop sites.\nTooltip-Usage Guidelines\n1. Don\u2019t use tooltips for information that is vital to task completion.\nUsers shouldn\u2019t need to find a tooltip in order to complete their task. Tooltips are best when they provide additional explanation for a form field unfamiliar to some users or reasoning for what may seem like an unusual request. Remember that tooltips disappear, so instructions or other directly actionable information, like field requirements, shouldn\u2019t be in a tooltip. (If it is, people will have to commit it to their\u00a0working memory\u00a0in order to be able to act upon it.)\n\u274c\nDon't:\nThe Amtrak website put password requirements into a tooltip (accessed via a mouse hover). This type of information is essential to a user successfully completing the\u00a0Create an Account\u00a0process and therefore should always be present on the screen.\n\u2705\nDo:\nFedEx used tooltips to provide additional information for the shipping-form fields. For example, the\u00a0Email\u00a0field had a tooltip explaining why that field was listed. (This tooltip was accessed via a mouse hover. )\n2.\u00a0Provide brief and helpful content inside the tooltip.\nTooltips with obvious or\nredundant text\nare not beneficial to users. If you can\u2019t think of particularly helpful content, don\u2019t offer a tooltip. Otherwise, you\u2019ll just add\ninformation pollution\nto your UI and waste the time of any users unlucky enough to activate that tooltip.\nAdditionally, lengthy content is no longer a \u2018tip\u2019, so keep it brief. Tooltips are\nmicrocontent\n, \u2014 short text fragments intended to be self-sufficient. Your copy can be single- or multiple-line long as long as it\u2019s relevant and it does not block related content.\n\u274c\nDon't:\nOn the Sprint website, a button with the label\u00a0Add\nnew line\u00a0also had a tooltip with the text\u00a0Add new line. This tooltip is\u00a0repetitive\u00a0and unnecessary.\n\u2705\nDo:\nAlibaba had a search bar with an unlabeled camera icon. When users hovered over this icon, a tooltip that\u00a0read\nSearch by image\u00a0appeared. This functionality was likely unfamiliar to many users, and therefore a tooltip describing its purpose was helpful.\n3. Support\nboth\nmouse\nand\nkeyboard hover.\nTooltips that appear only on mouse hover are inaccessible for users that rely on\nkeyboards\nto navigate. Be inclusive in your design and ensure that your tooltips are accessible via keyboards.\n\u274c\nDon't:\nThe McDonalds website did not support tooltips via keyboard triggers. A mouse-hover\u2013initiated tooltip (top) was not available when the user tabbed through the same page (bottom).\n\u2705\nDo:\nWikipedia supported keyboard triggers for tooltips. The same tooltips appeared on mouse hover and keyboard hover.\n4. Use tooltip arrows when multiple elements are nearby.\nArrows are beneficial to clearly identify to which element the tooltip is associated. When there are several nearby elements, these arrows help avoid confusion.\n\u274c\nDon't:\nPowerPoint had several icons in close proximity to one another. Without the tooltip arrows, it was difficult to know which tooltips correspond to which element.\n\u2705\nDo:\nWiteboard\u00a0used tooltip arrows to signify which icon the tip is for. Although the icons are fairly spaced out, the arrows provide additional clarity with minimal visual noise.\n5. Use tooltips consistently throughout your site.\nTooltips are hard to discover because they often lack visual cues. If tooltips are erratically displayed throughout your site, people may never discover them. It\u2019s important to be consistent and provide tooltips for all the elements in your design rather than just for some. If only some of the elements need additional explanation, use popup tips for these elements instead.\n\u274c\nDon't:\nThe Business Insider website used tooltips for 2 of 3 icons in its navigation menu. (Note: on the homepage of the Business Insider website, the globe icon did have a tooltip that read\u00a0Globe Icon. However, the label was not helpful, nor indicative of its functionality: a language selector.) In general, we advise against using\u00a0icons without labels\u00a0and hiding labels inside tooltips, but this offense is even graver when the tooltip labels are inconsistently deployed.\n\u2705\nDo:\nTodoist used tooltips consistently. All three icons in the main section have tooltips. Consistency instills confidence in users by meeting their expectations.\nAdditional Recommendations\nProvide Tooltips for Unlabeled Icons\nMost icons have some level of ambiguity, which is why we recommend text labels for all\nicons\n. If you\u2019re too stubborn to provide text labels for the icons on your site, the least you can do is provide your users with a descriptive tooltip.\nEnsure Tooltips Have Moderate Against the Background\nUsers generally look where they click (or hover). However, since tooltips lack, a moderate\ncontrast\nis important to ensure users see the text in the tooltip. Additionally, for users with visual impairments, a white page with light-grey tooltips is especially difficult to read.\nPosition Tooltips So They Don\u2019t Block Related Content\nWhen tooltips block the content they\u2019re related to, they cause users to repeat steps (i.e. move their mouse to close the tooltip, read the information or field again, hover to reveal tooltip). Test your tooltip positioning to ensure that the content does not block other information pertinent to the user\u2019s goal.\nConclusion\nTooltips are often a fail-safe for users when they can\u2019t understand a feature. Many of today\u2019s use cases for tooltips could be omitted if people followed other design guidelines (for example, labeling icons). Important information should always be on the page; therefore, tooltips shouldn\u2019t be essential for the tasks users need to accomplish on your site.\nThe more we strive for extreme\nminimalism\n, the more tooltips we\u2019ll need, and the more work for our users. The next time you consider a tooltip, ask: is the information in the tooltip necessary for users in order to complete a task? If the answer is no, a tooltip is well-suited. Otherwise, the information should be present on the screen.\nRelated Courses\nApplication Design for Web and Desktop\nComponents, design patterns, workflows, and ways of interacting with complex data\nInteraction\nhelp and user assistance,popups,Interaction Design,Application Design\nRelated Topics\nInteraction Design\nInteraction Design\nApplication Design\nLearn More:\nTesler\u2019s Law: Shift Complexity to Simplify UX\nLola Famulegun\n\u00b7\n3 min\nOverflow Menu Icons\nKate Kaplan\n\u00b7\n4 min\nUsability Heuristic 10: Help and Documentation\nMaria Rosala\n\u00b7\n3 min\nRelated Articles:\nMobile Tutorials: Wasted Effort or Efficiency Boost?\nAlita Kendrick\n\u00b7\n6 min\nInstructional Overlays and Coach Marks for Mobile Apps\nAurora Harley\n\u00b7\n6 min\nOnboarding Tutorials vs. Contextual Help\nPage Laubheimer\n\u00b7\n7 min\nWeb UX: Study Guide\nHuei-Hsin Wang\n\u00b7\n15 min\nOverlay Overload: Competing Popups Are an Increasing Menace\nKate Moran\n\u00b7\n6 min\nPop-ups and Adaptive Help Get a Refresh\nKatie Sherwin\n\u00b7\n6 min",
