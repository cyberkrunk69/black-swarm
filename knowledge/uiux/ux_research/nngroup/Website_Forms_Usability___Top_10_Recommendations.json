But since being delayed or forced to take clothes off in public is also guaranteed to annoy a lot of people, you\u2019d expect the TSA to get a pretty healthy volume of complaints.\nSo when I first saw the TSA\u2019s complaint form, the design error seemed so obvious that I wondered if it might be intentional. The form includes 2 buttons at the bottom:\nPreview\nand\nClear Form.\nThe\nPreview\nlabel is less than ideal, since most users would expect a\nSubmit\nor at least a\nNext\nbutton. But the real problem is the\nClear Form\nbutton, which actually deletes anything entered into the form.\nIntentional or not, this arrangement undoubtedly reduces the volume of complaints! However it also violates a form-design guideline we first wrote about more than 15 years ago: to\navoid\nReset\nbuttons\non web forms.\nTSA\u2019s web form includes a\nClear Form\nbutton, which violates usability guidelines dating back more than 15 years. To add insult to injury, the\nClear Form\nbutton is positioned closer to the input fields than the\nPreview\nbutton, thus making it even more likely that people will hit it by mistake (and violating the additional guideline of\nproximity between objects and their primary actions\n).\nI\u2019ve recently concluded that the design of this form was\nnot intentionally bad,\nbecause the TSA actually has a second complaint form that correctly uses a single\nSubmit\nbutton below the form. Since one form follows the guideline, it seems likely that the poor design of the other version is just accidental.\nAs a taxpayer, it\u2019s comforting to think that my government agency isn\u2019t deliberately using bad design to avoid hearing my comments. But from a UX perspective it\u2019s a painful reminder that despite the buzz and popularity of \u201cUX\u201d in recent years, basic understanding of usability is often still lacking. Even simple guidelines that ought to be well established are often unknown or disregarded.\nCareful form design has a huge impact on the speed with which users can understand and accurately complete a form. In fact, a\nrecent paper published in CHI by Seckler and her colleagues\nshows that, when forms follow basic usability guidelines, the completion time decreases significantly and users are\nalmost twice as likely to submit the form\nwith no errors from the first try (\n78%\none-try submissions in forms compliant with usability guidelines versus only\n42%\none-try submissions in forms violating them). If you wonder why your conversion funnel has big drop-offs on forms pages, this study may give you a clue: usability problems on forms really hurt business.\nDo your website forms follow usability best practices?\nIn This Article:\nBest Practices for Web Form Design\nConclusion\nBest Practices for Web Form Design\nThe best design solution for any given form depends on many factors: the length of the form, the context of use, and the data being collected. The exact implementation you should use may vary in certain circumstances, but this is no excuse for ignoring guidelines altogether. Instead, use these recommendations as a starting point, and if you stray from these established best practices make certain you have a good reason for doing so.\nKeep it short\n. The mathematician Blaise Pascal famously said: \u201cI have made this longer than usual because I have not had time to make it shorter.\u201d This principle applies to web forms as well as prose writing. Eliminating unnecessary fields requires more time, but the reduced user effort and increased completion rates make it worthwhile. Remove fields which collect information that can be (a) derived in some other way, (b) collected more conveniently at a later date, or (c) simply omitted. (We recently applied this technique to one of our own forms and reduced it from 6 fields down to only 2 fields.) Every time you cut a field or question from a form, you increase its\nconversion rate\n\u2014 the business case for this guideline is that simple.\nVisually group related labels and fields\n.\nLabels should be close to the fields\nthey describe (immediately above the field for mobile and shorter desktop forms, or next to the field for extremely long desktop forms). Avoid ambiguous spacing, where labels are equidistant from multiple fields, and make sure to\ninclude the label attribute\nfor screen readers. If your form asks about two different topics, section it into two separate groups of fields (and\ntag the groups\nfor screen readers).\nPresent fields in a single column layout\n. Multiple columns interrupt the vertical momentum of moving down the form. Rather than requiring users to visually reorient themselves, keep them in the flow by sticking to a single column with a separate row for each field. (Exceptions to this rule: short and/or logically related fields such as\nCity\n,\nState\n, and\nZip\nCode\ncan be presented on the same row.)\nUse logical sequencing\n. Stick to standard sequences both for fields (e.g.,\nCredit-card number\n,\nExpiration\ndate\n,\nSecurity\ncode\n) and for value choices (e.g\n., Standard shipping, 2-day shipping, 1-day shipping\n). But for field values, also consider usage frequency, and list the most common values first when possible. Help keyboard users by testing the\nTab\n-key navigation to ensure it follows the correct field sequence.\nThe Starbucks iPhone application, which includes a mobile form to let you customize your drink order, unfortunately hides the full \u2018\nDecaf\u2019\noption off screen to the right, requiring horizontal scrolling. If the full \u2018\nDecaf\u2019\nis more frequently selected that the other options, it should be displayed first.\nAvoid placeholder text\n. Designers like placeholder text because it eliminates visual clutter. But\nplaceholder text causes many usability problems\n, and is best avoided.\nMatch fields to the type and size of the input\n. Avoid drop-downs when there are only 2 or 3 options that could be displayed as radio buttons (which require only a single click or tap). Text fields should be about the same size as the expected input since it\u2019s extremely error prone when users can\u2019t see their full entry. For example, for 2,130 recent participants in the\nUX Conference\n, the user\u2019s city of residence ranged between 3 characters (Leo, Indiana) to 22 characters (San Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico). 99.9% of city names were 19 characters or shorter, making 19 characters a reasonable width for a city field.\nDistinguish optional and required fields\n. First, eliminate as many optional fields as possible (see the first recommendation above). If some fields truly are necessary, but only apply to a subset of users, don\u2019t make users find out through trial and error. Limit the form to only 1 or 2 optional fields, and clearly label them as optional.\nExplain any input or formatting requirements\n. If a field requires a specific format or type of input, state the exact instructions. Don\u2019t make users guess your obscure password requirements. The same applies to syntax rules such as punctuation or spacing for phone numbers or credit cards. (Though as much as possible you should eliminate these arbitrary formatting rules: death to parentheses for phone-number area codes!)\nNetgear\u2019s\nReset Password\nform explains its password requirements\u2026but only as an error message after you have failed the test. Don\u2019t set users up for failure with secret rules.\nAvoid\nReset\nand\nClear\nbuttons\n. The risk of accidental deletion outweighs the unlikely need to \u2018start over\u2019 on a web form. In forms that collect extremely sensitive input such as financial information, provide a \u2018\nCancel\u2019\nbutton to support those users who abandon the form and want to delete their information. But make sure that the\nCancel\nbutton has significantly less visual prominence than the\nSubmit\nbutton, to avoid accidental clicks.\nProvide highly visible and specific error messages\n.\nErrors should be signaled\nthrough a variety of cues, not solely through color: outline the field AND use red text AND use a heavier font, to ensure users don\u2019t overlook this critical information. Now is not the time to be subtle.\nErroneous input should be preserved so users can correct it, and accompanied by a specific explanation of the problem.\nConclusion\nThe usability of web forms is by no means a new topic. It has been covered in general usability references (including several NN/g books of both\ngeneral usability\nguidelines,\neyetracking usability\nresearch, and\nmobile usability\n). Many of the\n114 UX guidelines for e-commerce shopping carts\nare specialized issues in forms design. There are also entire books specifically written about\nform design\n, as well as academic studies demonstrating the effectiveness of complying with guidelines.\nThis brief summary is not intended to replace the in-depth analysis found in other resources: if you work extensively with form design, absorbing the intricacies of best practices in various situations is well worth your time.\nBut many bad web forms have problems that are not intricate or complex, and that could have been avoided by a simple reminder of what we already know. Take a look at the forms on your site and make sure that they don\u2019t make these well-known mistakes. Who knows, you just might double your\nconversion rate\n.\nReferences:\nMirjam Seckler, Silvia Heinz, Javier A. Bargas-Avila, Klaus Opwis, and Alexandre N. Tuch. 2014.
