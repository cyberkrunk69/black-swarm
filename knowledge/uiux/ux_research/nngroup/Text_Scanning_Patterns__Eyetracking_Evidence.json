They naturally\nattempt to be efficient\nand put in the least possible work for achieving their goal. They have learned that scanning can deliver almost the same amount of information as reading, but with significant less time and effort.\nIn This Article:\nScanning Patterns\nF-Pattern\nSpotted Pattern\nLayer-Cake Scanning Pattern\nCommitment Pattern\nSummary\nScanning Patterns\nHow people read on the web is highly contingent upon:\nTheir task\nTheir assumptions from previous experiences with the internet, site, or brand\nThe page layout\nThe type of page content (e.g., text versus images)\nOur\neyetracking\nresearch has identified multiple\nscanning patterns\nfor webpages. In this article, I focus on the\n4 patterns that people use to scan text\non the web \u00a0(listed below in increasing order, worst to best, of effectiveness):\nF-pattern\nSpotted pattern\nLayer-cake pattern\nCommitment pattern\nNote that there are other patterns that may be used when the page content involves a lot of images (e.g., the\nzigzag pattern\nand\nexhaustive review\n).\nF-Pattern\nIn the absence of subheadings and bullets, users tend to fixate on the words toward the beginning of lines and toward the top of the page. This scanning behavior results in an eyetracking pattern that resembles the capital letter F \u2014 hence, our name for\nthis pattern\n. In left-to-right languages, text on the left and towards the top of the page is read more than text on the right or towards the bottom of the page. (In\nright-to-left languages the pattern is mirrored\nvertically, with more attention being spent on the right side of the page.)\nTigersinCrisis.com: This heatmap aggregates data from\u00a047 people as they tried to learn how many Sumatran tigers live in the wild. The red color on this heatmap is an example of the F-shaped pattern \u2014 same today as when we first reported it in 2006.\nRight-to-left languages such as Arabic favor a reversed F-pattern, like the one seen in this study participant\u2019s gaze plot, as he was scanning a page on an Arabic website. (Each blue dot signifies a fixation. The lines between the dots represent saccades in which the user is moving the eyes and is virtually blind. These lines help us to follow the sequence of fixations. Larger dots represent longer fixations and the numbers denote their order.)\nSpotted Pattern\nThe spotted scanning pattern involves fixating on specific words or chunks of words spread throughout the page. The user chooses words because one of two reasons:\nThey visually stand out in the text\nbecause they are styled differently (e.g., \u00a0links, differently colored words, bolded words, bulleted lists).\nThey resemble\na word that the user looks for to accomplish the current task\n(for example, \u00a0capital letters for an address, digits for a piece of numeric information).\nThe spotted scanning pattern is slightly more operative than the F-pattern if the web designers did a\ngood job naming links\n, making important words look different from the rest of the body text, and creating bulleted lists.\nCaption: The heatmap shows an aggregate of six users who were using Wikipedia to learn about the dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov. The heatmap shows the \u00a0\u00a0F-pattern on the left and the spotted pattern on the right side of the page.\nCaption: A zoomed portion of the previous heatmap shows that the users were highly focused on the information about Baryshnikov\u2019s education, which was their task. The digits 1960 probably attracted attention since users were trying to learn when the dancer began his education.\nCaption: A user researching hikes in South America on southamericabackpacker.com scanned directly to the short, bulleted list in each hike\u2019s description. She probably found the content in the lists interesting or helpful since, after scanning the first bulleted list, she scanned to bulleted lists eight more times.\nA zoomed portion of the previous gaze plot shows the user scanning directly to the bulleted lists.\nLayer-Cake Scanning Pattern\nThe layer-cake scanning pattern consists of fixations placed mostly on the page\u2019s headings and subheadings. There are few other fixations on the text in between \u2014 that is, until users locate the heading they are interested in; at that point, they usually read the accompanying body text below. In an eyetracking heatmap or gaze plot, the layer-cake pattern looks like a set of horizontal stripes and blank spaces between them, resembling a layer cake (with cake on a level, then frosting, then cake, and so on).\nAside from reading almost every word, the layer-cake pattern is by far the most effective way in which users can scan pages.\nAs he was researching how to winterize a boat engine on Yamaha.com, a user scanned to the subheadings, which appeared as bold, light blue text juxtaposed against the plain, black body text.\nCommitment Pattern\nThe commitment pattern demonstrates traditional reading, not scanning. In this pattern, users fixate on all or most content words in the text passage. This pattern usually occurs when users are very interested or very motivated to read the content (for example, because they are studying for a test, or need to return an item on a specific site and are reading the instructions to do so).\nThe commitment pattern usually leads to the best\ncomprehension\n, even though it is the most time consuming. People spend more time and effort reading than they do when just scanning but reading everything gives them the opportunity to glean more information. Note though, that, even for the commitment pattern, text\ncomprehension\nis improved when the content is chunked and calls out its main points in subheadings. So, just because we know users may want to read or need to read certain content doesn\u2019t give us a pass to load webpages with walls of text.\nWe said before that the commitment scanning pattern usually occurs when people are highly motivated to be on the page and learn\n. People are motivated when they\n:\nknow and\ntrust\nthe source\nare loyal to the\nbrand\nbelieve they are in the best place to find the information (e.g., because they received aa referral, the page title matches their exact need, the description and title on the SERP match their thinking \u2014 we like to call this last phenomenon\nGoogle Gullibility\n)\nThe user was told she would be quizzed on the content in the article on nationalgeographic.com, and thus read almost every word, as the gaze plot shows.\nIn this case, a user was highly interested in the topic and exhibited\ncommitted scanning\non an article on theguardian.com.\nSummary\nEyetracking research helps us to see the details of how users look at content and how they choose to skip or read it. When you write, edit, or organize text on a webpage or in an app, keep in mind that how you present your content is likely to favor one of the four text-scanning patterns: the F-pattern, spotted, layer cake, and commitment patterns. Know that most users will read very little from a wall of text; support them by chunking your content into sections and bulleted lists, by using meaningful subheadings, and by special visual styling for keywords.\nFor more information about reading and scanning, see our full research report, \u201c\nHow People Read on the Web: The Eyetracking Evidence\n\u201d.
