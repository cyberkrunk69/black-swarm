This aesthetic-usability effect can mask UI problems during usability testing. Identify instances of the aesthetic-usability effect in your user research by watching what your users do, as well as listening to what they say.\nWhen a visual design looks good, it can make people overlook or forgive minor experience problems. This is referred to as the aesthetic-usability effect.\nThe\naesthetic-usability effect\nrefers to users\u2019 tendency to perceive attractive products as more usable. People tend to believe that things that\nlook\nbetter will\nwork\nbetter \u2014 even if they aren\u2019t actually more effective or efficient.\nIn This Article:\nImpact on User Experience\nLimitations of the Aesthetic-Usability Effect\nUsability-Testing Challenges Caused by the Aesthetic-Usability Effect\nInterpreting Positive Comments About Visuals During User Research\nA Brief History of the Aesthetic-Usability Effect\nConclusion\nReferences\nImpact on User Experience\nWhen users have\na positive emotional response to visual design, it makes them more tolerant of minor usability issues\n. This effect is a major reason why a good user experience can\u2019t just be functional. An attractive visual design isn\u2019t just \u201cnice to have\u201d \u2014 it plays a critical role in how your users perceive your product.\nApple\u2019s success is an excellent example of the competitive advantage of paying attention to aesthetics.\nLimitations of the Aesthetic-Usability Effect\nThe aesthetic-usability effect has limits.\nA pretty design can make users forgiving of\u00a0minor\nusability problems, but not of large ones.\nExample\nDuring a usability test, a participant visited the website of Arcadis, a consultancy. The site used large background photos on many pages throughout the site.\nAt first, the participant responded positively to the site\u2019s aesthetics:\n\"First thing, popping into this webpage, I see this beautiful, colorful image.\"\nHowever, after struggling to complete several tasks, the participant revised his opinion of the design:\n\"I feel like the whole screen being taken by this is pretty awesome once\u2026 And probably annoying the second time.\"\nArcadis used large, visually appealing images throughout its site. Initially, a study participant appreciated the photos; however he eventually became annoyed by the site\u2019s low information density when he could not find what he was looking for.\nForm and function should work together.\nWhen products suffer from severe usability issues, or when functionality is sacrificed for aesthetics, users tend to lose patience.\nUsability-Testing Challenges Caused by the Aesthetic-Usability Effect\nIt\u2019s a familiar frustration to facilitators in usability tests; You watch a participant struggle through a suboptimal experience, getting stuck and failing tasks. Then, when you ask them to comment on their experience, all they can talk about is the site\u2019s great color scheme.\nInstances like this are often the result of the aesthetic-usability effect. When an attractive interface helps hide problems in real life, that\u2019s a good thing for product teams. However, during user research,\nwhen our goal is to find problems so we can fix them, the aesthetic- effect can get in the way\n.\nExample\nFor example, during a usability-testing study, a participant encountered many issues while shopping on the FitBit site. The issues ranged from minor annoyances in the interaction design to serious flaws in the navigation. She was able to complete her task, but with difficulty.\nHowever, in a post-task questionnaire, she rated the site\u2019s ease of use very highly.\n\"It\u2019s the colors they used. Looks like the ocean, it\u2019s calm. Very good photographs.\"\nThe positive emotional response caused by the aesthetic appeal of the site\nmasked its usability issues and made them harder to identify.\nDespite encountering many problems while shopping on FitBit\u2019s site, a study participant still rated it highly. When asked for feedback, she commented only about its visual design \u2014 hindering the researcher from learning about the design\u2019s problems.\nInterpreting Positive Comments About Visuals During User Research\nUser researchers can\nidentify instances of the aesthetic-usability effect during user research by\npaying close attention to what users do and how it relates to what they say\n.\nLet\u2019s imagine we\u2019re facilitating a qualitative usability-test session. We observe the participant struggling through a few tasks on a site, but their final feedback is a vague comment on the attractiveness of the interface.\nWhenever we hear this kind of feedback that seems out of place, we need to consider three possibilities:\nThe participant might feel pressure to comment\u00a0on something.\nPeople often find it easier to give feedback on the visual design of sites.\nThe participant might feel pressure to compliment the product\n, especially if they believe you had a hand in creating the site.\nThe aesthetic-usability effect is interfering.\nOnce we determine\u00a0why\u00a0the participant gave positive feedback on visual design after a negative experience, we can work around the problem or prevent it from happening again, as explained below.\nCounteracting the Pressure to Comment During User Tests\nMany people are naturally uncomfortable with silence. Reduce the pressure to say something by establishing a low-stress vibe early in your session.\nReassure participants\nfrequently that what they\u2019re doing is helpful, even when they are not excessively verbalizing their actions.\nRemember that the communication between a moderator and a participant\nisn\u2019t the same as a regular conversation\n\u2014\nthe right amount of silence\nis part of the process.\nGive participants plenty of opportunity to comment during the session by\nasking\nopen-ended questions\n,\nbut don\u2019t push them too hard if they don\u2019t have anything to say.\nLowering the Pressure to Be Nice During User Tests\nSome people are naturally eager to please, and that will show during sessions. You can avoid this problem by distancing yourself from what you\u2019re testing.\nAt the beginning of the session,\nemphasize that you didn\u2019t design\nthe product (if you didn\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t lie to participants). If you did design the product, communicate that\nyou\u2019re there to learn\nfrom the participant and that negative comments won\u2019t hurt your feelings. It\u2019s more valuable to hear hard truths than false praise!\nAvoid showing emotional reactions\nto participants\u2019 comments through facial expressions or body language. This takes practice, but strive to keep a consistently pleasant and mildly interested vibe.\nWorking Around the Aesthetic-Usability Effect During User Tests\nLet\u2019s say we rule out the first two possibilities \u2014 we think the study participant is comfortable and doesn\u2019t feel pressure to say something or give empty compliments. In that case, a positive comment about visual design, along with struggles interacting with the site, could be an instance of the aesthetic-usability effect. While there are usability problems to be fixed, it\u2019s a sign that our visual design may be effective.\nSometimes you can\nwork around the aesthetic-usability effect by probing users to think beyond the visual layer\nof the experience. (But be careful not to ask leading questions.) Use vague questions like:\n\u201cDo you have any comments about how easy or difficult it was to find this information?\u201d\n\u201cWhat made this easy or difficult to read?\u201d\n\u201cWhat would you change about this app, if anything?\u201d\nYou might also return the user to a page that seemed particularly challenging and ask them to describe what happened.\nSometimes probing questions will help, but not always. Pushing too hard is likely to encourage participants to make up answers. Be willing to let go and move on to the next task.\nA Brief History of the Aesthetic-Usability Effect\nThe aesthetic-usability effect was first studied in the field of human\u2013computer interaction in 1995. Researchers Masaaki Kurosu and Kaori Kashimura from the Hitachi Design Center tested 26 variations of an ATM UI, asking the 252 study participants to rate each design on ease of use, as well as aesthetic appeal.\nThey found that the correlation between the participants\u2019 ratings of aesthetic appeal and perceived ease of use was stronger than the correlation between their ratings of aesthetic appeal and actual ease of use. Kurosu and Kashimura concluded that\nusers are strongly influenced by the aesthetics of any given interface, even when they try to evaluate the underlying functionality\nof the system. In his 2004 book\nEmotional Design\n, Don Norman explores this concept in depth as it applies to everyday objects.\nConclusion\nAesthetically pleasing interfaces are worth the investment. Visual designs that appeal to your users have the side effect of making your site appear orderly, well-designed, and professional. Users are more likely to try a visually appealing site, and they\u2019re more patient with minor issues.\nHowever, this effect is at its strongest when the aesthetics support and enhance the content and functionality. Additionally, this effect often influences user comments during research. As always, pay attention not only to what users say, but also to what they do.\nReferences\nKurosu, M., & Kashimura, K.
