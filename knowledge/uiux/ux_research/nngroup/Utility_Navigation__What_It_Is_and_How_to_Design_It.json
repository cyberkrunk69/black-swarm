These activities strongly affect website visitor satisfaction, user experience, and engagement. Put utilities where people expect and need them.\nIn This Article:\nUser Tools\nPlacement\nRecommendations\nExamples of Utility Navigation\nTest With Your Visitors\nUser Tools\nUtilities shape how people interact with your organization, website, and content.\nTools that websites provide vary with their size and mission, but many utility-navigation areas include:\nContact us\nFollow us\nLocale switcher / language tools\nLog in\n/\nSign up\nPrint\nSave\nShare\nSubscribe\nTools for changing font size\nView single page\nAlthough the\nshopping cart is a core feature of e-commerce sites\n(you could say that it\u2019s\nthe\ndefining feature), convention calls for the shopping cart icon to be found in the utility navigation as well. And, as we all know,\nfollowing conventions\nis an easy way to improve usability and increase conversion rates.\nSearch\n, another core feature, is also quite often found in the main utility area.\nEven though most utilitity navigation features are\nsecondary\nin nature, they are important for people under certain circumstances. Being secondary, they can be relegated to a secondary (less prominent) visual placement as long as this is done in compliance with ruling web conventions so that users can quickly find a utility when they need it.\nPlacement\nIn the past, the items in the utility navigation have been embedded in the content area, put in a sidebar, or stuck in a navigation bar. In recent years, however, many of the tools have migrated to the top-right corner of web pages. This prominent placement makes them always visible, and, in general, easier to notice. We often see users looking in that area for tools, especially for items such as\nLog\nin, Search,\nand\nMy\nAccount\n.\nIBM: Homepage utility navigation is found mainly at the top, with following tools in the middle, and\nContact\nlink at the bottom.\nIBM: Top-right detail\nInformational websites (and site sections dedicated to news and articles) often split utilities, with\nsitewide tools\nplaced top-right, and\narticle tools\ntop-center in the content area.\nSubscribe\ntools (newsletters, RSS, social media, etc.) are often placed in bottom navigation areas.\nSharing\ntools frequently appear at the beginning and/or end of articles, recipes, lists, and other informational pages that people are most likely to want to share.\n(At first, it might seem confusing to place utility navigation in 4 different areas, but remember that it\u2019s only information architecture geeks who think of these things in terms of \u201cutility navigation\u201d vs. other forms of navigation. To the average user, tools that are used for different things are therefore different beasts and can be found in different parts of the zoo without causing confusion.)\nOpen Culture: Utility navigation is grouped in typical places on the page.\nSome organizations try to hide utility navigation under hamburger menus (3 horizontal lines) or other click-to-display elements, such as gear icons and slide-out drawers.\nThis tidy-screen approach can backfire\n, though, so it\u2019s best to test and monitor to make sure your visitors actually use these new interaction conventions and that you haven\u2019t hidden important tools too well.\nIt's a bad idea to ignore principles of design, even when big companies are doing that.\nRecommendations\nProvide icons with text labels\n. People like icons, but they don\u2019t understand them and have trouble memorizing them. Plus websites use icons inconsistently. Don\u2019t rely on hover-text explanations (tool tips) that won\u2019t display on touch screens. Use words, or both words and icons, for good accessibility, comprehension, and translation. Researchers find that the hamburger menu is used more when it is labeled\nMenu\nand has a border around it to make it look more like a button, for example.\nTest for both comprehension and interaction if you hide mission-critical tools under navigation icons\n(hamburgers, ellipses, gears, etc.) because people tend not to click on what they don\u2019t understand.\nThese emerging conventions work best on mobile platforms\n, where there is very little distraction in the user interface.\nGroup utilities where people expect them\n: either in the top-right corner or next to the content they affect. It\u2019s okay to blend them in with other navigation structures or to put some secondary tools in the bottom navigation area, because people tend to look at navigation areas quite closely when hunting for things they need.\nMake controls look like controls, and use typical names for them\n.\nSeparate the two types of social-media icons.\nDivide the\nFollow us\nfrom the\nShare this\n, because they tend to look alike, but they do very different things.\nDon\u2019t go wild with sharing tools and sharing counters\n, because\nresearch shows\npeople do more sharing with their own tools and methods. Some websites have dropped embedded social-media\nShare\nand\nLike\ntools altogether, because the visual clutter and loss of visitor privacy weren\u2019t worth the minimal engagement those tools were getting.\nInclude subscription tools\n. Make it easy for readers to follow features, authors, and feeds.\nFollow\nsearch-tool best practices\n.\nDon\u2019t use flags for locales\nunless there are only a few locales that share the same language (so the flags used would be familiar to most readers).\nUse the name of the language in its own character set\ninstead.\nPut\nLog In\nand\nSign Up\nnext to each other\n.\nUse colors and buttons to emphasize the most important actions\nand to draw the eye to the utility area.\nExamples of Utility Navigation\nThe Christian Science Monitor\nThe Christian Science Monitor: top-right detail\nGeneral Electric (ge.com)\nGE: Top-right corner detail\nNew York Times puts utility navigation on the right side of the page.\nNew York Times: Top-right detail\nThe Age: Top and bottom utilities, with subscriptions in the middle\nWashington Post: Top\nWashington Post: Bottom\nIcons at Niconico are cute, but it\u2019s the text that makes them comprehensible, translatable, and in some cases, visible.\nTest With Your Visitors\nUtility navigation is becoming more mature in its conventions and placement. Whenever that happens on the web, it\u2019s tempting to take advantage of people\u2019s familiarity with popular websites by following their lead. In the end, though, the most usable solutions will win, so test to ensure that your navigation works for your users and that you\u2019re not hiding tools they need.\nWe offer several courses on\nuser testing\n,\nnavigation\n, and\nvisual design\nthat count toward\nUX Certification\n.\nRelated Courses\nInformation Architecture\nOrganize and structure information to improve findability and discoverability\nInteraction\nInformation Architecture,Navigation,Social Media\nRelated Topics\nInformation Architecture\nInformation Architecture\nNavigation\nSocial Media\nLearn More:\nOrganize Information with \"LATCH\"\nHuei-Hsin Wang\n\u00b7\n4 min\nCard Sorting: Why & When\nSamhita Tankala\n\u00b7\n3 min\nInformation Architecture: 3 Key Models\nPage Laubheimer\n\u00b7\n3 min\nRelated Articles:\n5 Information Architecture Warning Signs in Your Analytics Reports\nKathryn Whitenton and  Katie Sherwin\n\u00b7\n7 min\nNavigation: You Are Here\nSusan Farrell\n\u00b7\n6 min\nAudience-Based Navigation: 5 Reasons to Avoid It\nKatie Sherwin\n\u00b7\n5 min\nTop 3 IA Questions about Navigation Menus\nKathryn Whitenton\n\u00b7\n7 min\nThe Difference Between Information Architecture (IA) and Navigation\nJen Cardello\n\u00b7\n3 min\nFlat vs. Deep Website Hierarchies\nKathryn Whitenton\n\u00b7\n5 min",
