For us, it's not so much that things get 10 times bigger or smaller;\nmost user interfaces are about the same physical size\n, as dictated by the need to work with the human body. For example, a BlackBerry keyboard is about 1/5 the size of a PC keyboard \u2014 it wouldn't work at 1/10 the size. And, except for wall-sized displays, nothing is 10 times bigger than a PC interface.\nBut in the\n\"4th dimension\" of time\n, user experience phenomena work across many powers of 10.\nIn This Article:\n0.1 Second\n1 Second\n10 Seconds\n1 Minute\n10 Minutes\n1 Hour\n1 Day\n1 Week\n1 Month\n1 Year\n10 Years\n100 Years\n0.1 Second\nMany of the effects of perceptual psychology take place at this time scale.\nA research team lead by\nDr. Gitte Lindgaard\nfound that people can make rough\ndecisions about a web page's visual appeal\nafter being exposed to it for as little as\n50 ms\n, which is 1/20 of a second (50 ms is only half of 0.1 second, but it's close enough for the purposes of a \"powers of 10\" analysis.)\nIn Lindgaard's study, screen images were flashed at test participants for 0.05 seconds, after which they could distinguish between more and less attractive designs. It's important to realize that this is\nnot how users actually approach web pages\nduring real use. For one, pages don't flash on the screen for an instant and then go away. Instead, they render over a period of a second (if we're lucky \u2014 otherwise more). Also, people spend a few seconds looking over the page before they decide what to do about it.\nStill, the study does show that\npeople can form basic visual impressions very quickly\n, at the limits of human perception.\n0.1 second is the\nresponse time limit\nif you want\nusers to feel like their actions are directly causing something to happen on the screen\n. For example, if you click on an expandable menu and see the expanded version in less than 0.1 seconds, then it feels as if\nyou\nmade the menu open up. If it takes longer than 0.1 seconds for the revised state to appear, then the response doesn't feel instantaneous \u2014 instead, it feels as if the\ncomputer\nis doing something to make the menu open.\nThus,\nto create the illusion of\ndirect manipulation\n, a user interface must be faster than 0.1 second\n.\nIn\neyetracking studies\n, most of the fixations we track last little more than 0.1 seconds. In fact, the first thing people notice when running their first eyetracking study is how\nfast\nthe human eye moves across web pages (or other stimuli). Users look at things very briefly, which is a big reason to emphasize clarity in\ncontent usability\n.\n1 Second\nWhen the computer takes more than 0.1 second but less than 1 second to respond to your input,\nit feels like the computer is causing the result\nto appear. Although users notice the short delay, they\nstay focused on their current train of thought\nduring the one-second interval.\nThis means that during 1-second response times, users retain the\nfeeling of being in control\nof the interaction even though they notice that it's a\n2-way\ninteraction (between them and the computer). By contrast, with 0.1 second response times, users simply feel like they're doing something themselves.\nFor web usability, this means that\nnew pages must display within 1 second for users to feel like they're navigating freely\n; any slower and they feel held back by the computer and don't click as readily.\nIn the web's early days, it was impossible to achieve such download times. Then, many guidelines advised that you minimize the number of page views required, because going to a new page was unpleasant if it took more than a second to do so.\nToday, with broadband widely available, subsecond download times are eminently possible and should definitely be the goal. The main problem now is not so much big graphics or heavy\npage weight\n(number of megabytes to download). Now, slow response times are more frequently caused by excessive widgets and other dynamic elements that bloat the design and slow down the server.\n(Also, it's important to remember that some people still use dial-up, especially in rural areas or developing countries. Mobile devices also have slower connections, so your\nwebsite's mobile version\nusually needs a serious diet.)\n10 Seconds\nAfter 1 second, users get impatient and notice that they're waiting for a slow computer to respond. The longer the wait, the more this impatience grows; after about 10 seconds, the average attention span is maxed out. At that point, the user's mind starts wandering and doesn't retain enough information in\nshort-term memory\nto easily resume the interaction once the computer finally loads the next screen.\nMore than 10 seconds, and you\nbreak the flow\n. Users will often\nleave the site\nrather than trying to regain the groove once they've started thinking about other things.\n10 seconds is also the time users typically allocate to\nexamining a page before deciding\nthat it's so bad that they're going to leave.\nThe\naverage page visit lasts about 30 seconds\n, but the more experienced the users are, the less time they allocate to each web page. People are impatient on the internet. Instantly gratify them, or they're out.\n1 Minute\nUsers should be able to\ncomplete simple tasks in about 1 minute\n. Awkward sites that require much more than a minute for basic tasks \u2014 such as transferring money from a savings to a checking account \u2014 will be abandoned.\nLikewise, most\ninternet videos\nshould last no more than 1\u20132 minutes because people don't like passively watching something for much longer than that while they're in the active frame of mind induced by web surfing.\nMost website visits last about 2\u20134 minutes.\n10 Minutes\n10 minutes would be a\nlong\nvisit to a website. In one case, for example, we followed a user researching a B2B\npurchase across 25 site visits\n. The longest site visit? 7 minutes.\n1 Hour\nMost usability studies last 1\u20132 hours because it's hard to\nrecruit users\nto come in for longer tests. In fact, unless we're\ntesting with children\n\u2014 for whom an hour is the max \u2014 we usually limit our test sessions to 90 minutes. People tire after an hour or two.\nPeople complete most web tasks in less than an hour. In one study,\n1/2 of ecommerce purchases occurred within 28 minutes\nof the user's arrival at the website. Of course, the other half were spread across longer intervals, often including multiple visits that were days apart.\n1 Day\n1 day is the maximum turnaround for\ncustomer service\nrequests, although you should send\ntransactional email and confirmation messages\nwithin 1 minute to keep users from wondering whether their action \u2014 such as a purchase or address change \u2014 has been received correctly.\nThe difference here is that users assume that customer service requires\nhuman\nintervention, so they don't think the\ncomputer\nis broken if they don't hear back within 1 minute. Faster service is still appreciated, of course.\nMany users\nhabitually\ncheck certain content sources on a daily basis. (A behavior called\nmonitoring\n.) So, if your topic warrants, it might be smart to publish a daily\nemail newsletter\n. (But be warned: you're begging for unsubscribes if you have a slower-moving topic and publish too often.)\n1 Week\nOther habits are weekly (or monthly, or yearly \u2014 depending on seasons, holidays, or tax filings). In our studies of how people use\nsocial networking\n, we found that Facebook and Twitter tend to be daily habits (or more for some people), whereas MySpace and LinkedIn tend to be checked weekly.\nTasks that require extensive research or big decisions often stretch across a week or more, as users gradually progress in their thinking. So, while each individual visit to any given website might last only a few minutes, the full process takes much longer. This means that sites must support\nrevisitation\nbehaviors, for example by keeping track of what users have done in previous visits.\nWeekly and monthly behaviors don't lend themselves to in-lab usability testing, so we often study them through\ndiary studies\nor other more field-oriented methods.\n1 Month\nBusiness processes often take even more time than individual decisions because of the need to get various people on the same page. For both\nB2B sites\nand\nenterprise collaboration\n, it's common to have a month or more pass between the initial action and the completion of that workflow.\n1 Year\nOnce people have used a website for about a year, they graduate to being\nexperienced users\nwith some knowledge about how the site works. It takes a long time to build such expertise because of the superficial in-and-out way users approach websites. Each visit is short, and people don't spend much effort on explicitly seeking out new features and building their skills.\nNevertheless, people do eventually learn something about the sites they use frequently. This is why\nAmazon.com can get away with very complex\nproduct pages that are cluttered with more features than I recommend for most sites: many of Amazon's customers have used the site for years and thus have the background required to cope with the site's numerous features.\nOrganizational change\nusually takes years. For example, it typically takes 2\u20133 years for a company to progress to the next level of the\n8 stages of UX process maturity\n.\n10 Years\nIt takes almost 10 years for users to develop\ndeep expertise\nin a complex system such as Unix. The learning curve thus continues for many years past the initial uptake of simple features that we usually study. Throughout these first 10 years, people gradually explore more and more corners of the system and slowly build their skills.\nData often lives for decades\n\u2014 far longer than any individual user interface that people use to access the data. This means that you need\nmigration tools\nto help users make sense of old data and transfer it into new systems. For example, photo sharing sites should give users tools to import old photos. Eventually, such sites will also need to cope with the exploding mass of thousands of decade-old uploads.\n100 Years\nIf organizational change takes years,\nsocial changes\ncan take decades, getting close to the 100-year mark in some cases, which is why we're not seeing them yet for many aspects of computing. For example, it's possible that collaboration systems will\ndepopulate cities\n. It's also possible that the change to\nshorter, more superficial\ninformation nuggets instead of immersive, linear information will\nundermine education\nas people lose the ability to learn and study harder concepts. (Or that online education will kill or drastically change universities, for example by making them centers for exercises and workshops without any lectures.)\nWe don't yet have 100-year effects in user interfaces, because people haven't yet used computers for their entire lifetime. But eventually this will happen. We're already many years into the era when many people started using computers as children. And we're certainly seeing more and more uptake of web use and other computer activities among\nsenior citizens\n.\nCombine these two trends, and we'll eventually have people who've used computers all of their lives \u2014 or 100 years for the more long-lived members of the species. What'll that mean? Let's discuss this in a few more years.\nRelated Courses\nThe Human Mind and Usability\nUse psychology to predict and explain how your customers think and act\nInteraction\nWeb Page UX Design\nStrategically combine content, visuals, and interactive components to design successful web pages\nInteraction\nHuman Computer Interaction,Web Usability,longitudinal studies,timing,performance,response time\nRelated Topics\nHuman Computer Interaction\nHuman Computer Interaction\nWeb Usability\nLearn More:\nEnable cookies\nto watch NN/g videos\nThe 3 Response Time Limits in Interaction Design\nJakob Nielsen\n\u00b7\n4 min\nSteering Law for Cursor and Mouse Movements in a GUI Tunnel\nLexie Kane\n\u00b7\n3 min\nFitts's Law\nLexie Kane\n\u00b7\n2 min\nObserve, Test, Iterate, and Learn (Don Norman)\nDon Norman\n\u00b7\n4 min\nRelated Articles:\nHow Long Do Users Stay on Web Pages?\nJakob Nielsen\n\u00b7\n4 min\nThe Role of Enhancement in Web Design\nRaluca Budiu\n\u00b7\n7 min\nDirect Access vs. Sequential Access: Definition\nRaluca Budiu\n\u00b7\n7 min\nTV Meets the Web\nJakob Nielsen\n\u00b7\n5 min\nPopups: 10 Problematic Trends and Alternatives\nAnna Kaley\n\u00b7\n12 min\nSignal\u2013to\u2013Noise Ratio\nXinyi Chen\n\u00b7\n6 min",
