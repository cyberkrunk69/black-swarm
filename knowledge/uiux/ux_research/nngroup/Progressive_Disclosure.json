For example: Who wants line numbers in a word processor? Millions of users, that's who, including most big law firms.)\nUsers want\nsimplicity\n; they don't have time learn a profusion of features in enough depth to select the few that are optimal for their needs.\nProgressive disclosure is one of the best ways to satisfy both of these conflicting requirements. It's a simple, yet powerful idea:\nInitially, show users\nonly a few\nof the most important options.\nOffer a\nlarger set\nof specialized options upon request. Disclose these secondary features only if a user asks for them, meaning that most users can proceed with their tasks without worrying about this added complexity.\nThe\nprint dialog box\nis the classic example of progressive disclosure. When you issue the command to print a document, you'll get a dialog box with a small set of choices \u2014 mainly, how many copies to print, but possibly a few other variations, such as whether to print the entire document or a subset, and which printer to use. Sadly, print dialog boxes have grown bloated over the past decade, and some applications offer an initial dialog box with highly detailed options that would be better placed in a secondary dialog box.\nThe initial print dialog box typically contains one or more buttons for advanced options. These buttons lead to secondary dialogs that let users specify rarely used settings, such as scaling and printing the pages in reverse sequence. If the user clicks the advanced options button, the system discloses the additional features.\nIn This Article:\nApplications vs. Websites\nBenefits of Progressive Disclosure\nUsability Criteria for Progressive Disclosure\nStaged Disclosure: One Step at a Time\nManaging Complexity\nApplications vs. Websites\nProgressive disclosure has long been one of\napplication design's primary guidelines\n, because most applications have so many commands, features, and options that it makes sense to defer some to a secondary area. Websites have grown so complex that\nprogressive disclosure is a good idea for many information-rich sites\nas well.\nDeferring secondary material is also a key guideline for mobile design\n.\nAn ecommerce site, for example, might mention a few key product attributes on the primary\nproduct page\nand let users click through to a secondary page to see the product's full specifications.\nHypertext\nprovides a simple implementation of progressive disclosure: higher-level pages contain higher-level concepts and simplified descriptions, and lower-level pages fill in the details for those users who want to know everything.\nBenefits of Progressive Disclosure\nIn a system designed with progressive disclosure, the very fact that something appears on the initial display tells users that it's\nimportant\n.\nFor\nnovice users\n, this helps prioritize their attention so that they spend time only on features that are most likely to be useful to them. By hiding the advanced settings, progressive disclosure helps novice users avoid mistakes and saves them the time they would have spent contemplating features that they don't need.\nFor\nadvanced users\n, the smaller initial display also saves them time because they avoid having to scan past a large list of features they rarely use.\nProgressive disclosure thus improves 3 of\nusability's 5 components\n: learnability, efficiency of use, and error rate.\nYou might assume that by initially focusing users' attention on a few core features, they might build a limiting mental model of the system and thus be unable to understand all of their options.\nResearch says that these are groundless worries\n: people understand a system\nbetter\nwhen you help them prioritize features and spend more time on the most important ones.\nUsability Criteria for Progressive Disclosure\nSimple as the concept may seem, there are\ntwo things you must get right\nwhen designing for progressive disclosure:\nYou must get the right\nsplit between initial and secondary features\n. You have to disclose everything that users frequently need up front, so that they have to progress to the secondary display only on rare occasions. Conversely, the primary list can't contain too many options or you'll fail to sufficiently focus users' attention on truly important issues. Finally, the initial display can't contain confusing features or you'll slow down user performance.\nIt must be\nobvious how users progress\nfrom the primary to the secondary disclosure levels:\nFirst, make the\nmechanics\nof this operation simple. For a website, follow the guidelines for\nvisualizing links\n. For an application, place the advanced features button in a clearly visible spot.\nSecond, label the button or link in a way that sets clear\nexpectations\nfor what users will find when they progress to the next level. (In other words, the progression should have strong\ninformation scent\n.)\nRegarding the first point, how do you\ndetermine which features the initial disclosure level should contain?\nTask analysis and field studies can give you insights into what people need, even if you're working on a new design. If you're improving an existing system, frequency-of-use statistics can help you prioritize the features. For a website,\nbasic analytics\ntell you how often people look at various pages. However, you must supplement such analytics with\nobservational usability testing\nto discern whether a page gets many hits because users\nwant\nit or because they simply enter the page by\nmistake\n. For an application, you can get even more detailed usage data by instrumenting the code to record how often people use various features.\nIn theory, there's no reason why you can't have\nmultiple levels of progressive disclosure\n. Even though the secondary level is for experienced users, there are still limits to how complex it should be; some options might be so specialized or rare that you should relegate them to a tertiary level. In practice, designs that go beyond 2 disclosure levels typically have low usability because users often get lost when moving between the levels.\nIf you have so many features that you need 3 or more levels, consider\nsimplifying your design\n. If you can't scale back the complexity, at least chunk your advanced features into groups that make sense, so that users need check only one place and can ignore any areas that they don't need. Use traditional techniques like\ncard sorting\nto get the grouping right, and invest extra time in\nuser testing\nto ensure that your design supports real task performance, including both common tasks and advanced tasks.\nIt's also possible to have\nmultiple secondary displays\n, each of which is revealed by a different control on the initial display. The obvious upside to this is that you can accommodate more features without introducing a tertiary level. The obvious downside is added complexity on the initial level, since users must consider multiple buttons for advanced options.\nBecause progressive disclosure's goal is to expedite use of the initial display, it's rarely a good idea to offer multiple ways to progress to secondary options. If you must do this, however, at least ensure that you clearly label all choices.\nStaged Disclosure: One Step at a Time\nStaged disclosure is a variant in which users step through a linear sequence of options, with a subset displayed at each step.\nWizards\nare the classic example of staged disclosure. The differences between progressive disclosure and staged disclosure are:\nProgressive Disclosure\nStaged Disclosure\nInitial display\nCore\nfeatures\nFeatures that users access\nfirst\nin the task sequence\nSubsequent display(s)\nSecondary\nfeatures\nFeatures that users access\nlater\nin the task, even if these features are equally important (or more important)\nDo users access subsequent displays?\nUsually not\n\u2014 most users get what they need on the initial display\nYes\n\u2014 unless users stop the task before completing the sequence\nNavigation between displays\nHierarchical\n: users start at the initial display and, if necessary, move to the secondary display and then (often) return to the initial display\nLinear\n: users progress through the task one step at a time\nMain usability benefit\nLearnability\n: novice users are focused on the most useful features and confusingly advanced features are hidden\nSimplicity\n: each step is simple and its purpose is clear because features that belong to other steps are hidden\nStaged disclosure is\nuseful\nwhen you can divide a task into distinct steps that have little interaction. It is\nproblematic\nwhen the steps are interdependent and users must alternate between them.\nWhen researching the usability of\n46 web-based applications\n, we tested a hotel reservation system that squeezed all the reservation stages onto a single screen. Comparing this design with most hotel sites \u2014 which distribute the reservation stages over multiple pages \u2014 shows the benefits and drawbacks of staged disclosure:\nThe single-screen design worked well when users were trying to decide which hotel room to get because it displayed, on a single screen, the availability and prices for different hotel room categories across various date options considered by the user. Most hotel sites show room categories, prices, dates, and availability across multiple pages, making it more difficult to experiment with various what-if scenarios. People use all of these features together, with frequent back-and-forth modifications, so they should be on 1 screen.\nThe single-screen design also caused usability problems because it included a segment for users to enter their address and credit card information. Hotels need such information to complete a booking, but it's not needed during the exploratory phase when users are experimenting with various reservations. Staged disclosure would defer the payment details to a secondary screen. Doing so would leave more space on the first screen for room information and the exploratory interface, thus protecting users from various errors that result when too many options are displayed at the same time.\nAs this example shows, staged disclosure requires a thorough task analysis to understand which options are used together and which are better thought of as separate stages. The more features you can defer, the simpler your design, but if you divide the task into too many steps, users get bogged down by excess navigation.\nThe single-screen hotel reservation design would have been better as a 2-screen design \u2014 something overlooked by many na\u00efve analyses that consider 1 screen vs. 5 screens to be the only choices. Testing the 1-screen design with real users (which the hotels don't seem to have done) quickly shows that the compromise of a 2-screen solution would be better.\nManaging Complexity\nProgressive disclosure and staged disclosure are both strategies to manage the\nprofusion of features\nand options in modern user interfaces. They are both more than 30 years old and have proven themselves useful in countless applications, and even some websites. Try them \u2014 but stay aware of their weaknesses.\nRelated Courses\nApplication Design for Web and Desktop\nComponents, design patterns, workflows, and ways of interacting with complex data\nInteraction\nApplication Design,Interaction Design,accordions,forms,interfaces\nRelated Topics\nApplication Design\nApplication Design\nInteraction Design\nLearn More:\nEnable cookies\nto watch NN/g videos\nProgressive Disclosure\nRaluca Budiu\n\u00b7\n5 min\nIcon Interpretation vs. Recognizability\nKate Kaplan\n\u00b7\n4 min\nIs the Floppy Disk Dead?\nKate Kaplan\n\u00b7\n4 min\n2-Factor Authentication (2-FA)\nTim Neusesser\n\u00b7\n4 min\nRelated Articles:\nTop 10 Application-Design Mistakes\nJakob Nielsen and  Page Laubheimer\n\u00b7\n13 min\n6 Tips for Successful Personalization\nAmy Schade\n\u00b7\n6 min\nWireflows: A UX Deliverable for Workflows and Apps\nPage Laubheimer\n\u00b7\n6 min\nInput Controls for Parameters: Balancing Exploration and Precision with Sliders, Knobs, and Matrices\nPage Laubheimer\n\u00b7\n9 min\nCheckboxes vs. Radio Buttons\nJakob Nielsen\n\u00b7\n6 min\nIndicators, Validations, and Notifications: Pick the Correct Communication Option\nKim Flaherty\n\u00b7\n9 min",
