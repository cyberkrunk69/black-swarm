We work around these limitations by closing programs when we aren't using them.\nJust like computers,\nhuman brains have a limited amount of processing power\n(as further discussed in our course on\nThe Human Mind and Usability\n). When the amount of information coming in exceeds our ability to handle it, our performance suffers. We may take longer to understand information, miss important details, or even get overwhelmed and abandon the task.\nIn the field of user experience, we use the following\ndefinition\n: the\ncognitive load\nimposed by a user interface is the amount of mental resources that is required to operate the system. Informally, you can think of mental resources as \"brain power\" \u2014 more formally, we're talking about slots in working memory.\nThe term \"cognitive load\" was originally coined by psychologists to describe the mental effort required to learn new information. Though web browsing is a much more casual activity than formal education, cognitive load is still important: users must learn how to use a site's navigation, layout, and transactional forms. And even when the site is fairly familiar, users must still carry around the information that is relevant to their goal. For instance, when planning a vacation, the users\u2019 cognitive load includes interface-related knowledge and specific vacation-related constraints that they may have (such as price and timeframe).\nWhen a computer can't handle our processing demands, we can simply upgrade to a newer, more powerful machine.

When the amount of information coming in exceeds our ability to handle it, our performance suffers. We may take longer to understand information, miss important details, or even get overwhelmed and abandon the task.\n\nIn the field of user experience, we use the following **definition**: the **cognitive load** imposed by a user interface is the amount of mental resources that is required to operate the system.

Many of our [top usability guidelines](https://www.nngroup.com/courses/fundamentals/) \u2014 from [chunking content](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/short-term-memory-and-web-usability/) to [optimizing response times](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/website-response-times/) \u2014 are aimed at minimizing cognitive load. In addition to these basics, there are 3 more tips for minimizing cognitive load:\n\n1. **Avoid visual clutter**: [redundant links](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/navigation-cognitive-strain/), irrelevant images, and meaningless typography flourishes slow users down. (Note that **meaningful** links, images, and typography are valuable design elements; it is only when overused that these backfire and actually impair usability.)\n2. **Build on existing [mental models](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mental-models/)**: People already have mental models about how websites work, based on their past experiences visiting other sites. When you use labels and layouts that they've encountered on other websites, you reduce the amount of learning they need to do on your site.\n3. **Offload tasks**: Look for anything in your design that requires users to read text, remember information, or make a decision. Then look for alternatives: can you show a picture, re-display previously entered information, or set a smart default? You won't be able to shift all tasks away from users, but every task you eliminate leaves more mental resources for the decisions that truly are essential.\n\n## Related Courses\n\n- [#### Persuasive and Emotional Design\n\n  Create delightful experiences that touch, convince, or excite your audience\n\n  Interaction](/courses/persuasive-emotional-design/?lm=minimize-cognitive-load&pt=article)\n- [#### The Human Mind and Usability\n\n  Use psychology to predict and explain how your customers think and act\n\n  Interaction](/courses/human-mind/?lm=minimize-cognitive-load&pt=article)\n\nPsychology and UX,Human Computer Interaction\n\n## Related Topics\n\n- Psychology and UX\n  [Psychology and UX](/topic/psychology-and-ux/)\n- [Human Computer Interaction](/topic/human-computer-interaction/)\n\n## Learn More:\n\n[![Tesler\u2019s Law: Shift Complexity to Simplify UX](https://media.nngroup.com/media/videos/thumbnails/Teslers_Law-_Shift_Complexity_to_Simplify_UX_Thumbnail.jpg.1300x728_q75_autocrop_crop-smart_upscale.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaAFBlfTdg \"Tesler\u2019s Law: Shift Complexity to Simplify UX on YouTube (new window)\")\n\nEnable cookies\n\u00a0to watch NN/g videos\n\nTesler\u2019s Law: Shift Complexity to Simplify UX\n\n Lola Famulegun\n\u00b7\n3 min\n\n- [![](https://media.nngroup.com/media/videos/thumbnails/Inattentional_Blindness_in_Interfaces_Thumbnail.jpg.650x364_q75_autocrop_crop-smart_upscale.jpg)\n\n  Inattentional Blindness in Interfaces\n\n  Megan Chan\n  \u00b7\n  4 min](/videos/inattentional-blindness-in-interfaces/?lm=minimize-cognitive-load&pt=article)\n- [![](https://media.nngroup.com/media/videos/thumbnails/The_Hidden_Bias_Killing_Your_UX_Insights_Common_Knowledge_Effect_Thumbnail.jpg.650x364_q75_autocrop_crop-smart_upscale.jpg)\n\n  The Hidden Bias Killing Your UX Insights: Common-Knowledge Effect\n\n  Evan Sunwall\n  \u00b7\n  4 min](/videos/common-knowledge-effect/?lm=minimize-cognitive-load&pt=article)\n- [![](https://media.nngroup.com/media/videos/thumbnails/What_is_Cognitive_Load_Thumbnail.jpg.650x364_q75_autocrop_crop-smart_upscale.jpg)\n\n  What Is Cognitive Load?\n\n  Maddie Brown\n  \u00b7\n  4 min](/videos/cognitive-load/?lm=minimize-cognitive-load&pt=article)\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n- [Psychology for UX: Study Guide\n\n  Tanner Kohler\n  \u00b7\n  11 min](/articles/psychology-study-guide/?lm=minimize-cognitive-load&pt=article)\n- [Change Blindness Causes People to Ignore What Designers Expect Them to See\n\n  Kathryn Whitenton\n  \u00b7\n  4 min](/articles/change-blindness/?lm=minimize-cognitive-load&pt=article)\n- [Memory Recognition and Recall in User Interfaces\n\n  Raluca Budiu\n  \u00b7\n  8 min](/articles/recognition-and-recall/?lm=minimize-cognitive-load&pt=article)\n- [Expandable Menus: Pull-Down, Square, or Pie?\n\n  Raluca Budiu\n  \u00b7\n  9 min](/articles/expandable-menus/?lm=minimize-cognitive-load&pt=article)\n- [User-Experience Quiz: 2015 UX Year in Review\n\n  Raluca Budiu\n  \u00b7\n  3 min](/articles/ux-quiz-15/?lm=minimize-cognitive-load&pt=article)\n- [Satisficing: Quickly Meet Users\u2019 Main Needs\n\n  Kathryn Whitenton\n  \u00b7\n  4 min](/articles/satisficing/?lm=minimize-cognitive-load&pt=article)",
