Distinguish between types of tabs, design them for visual clarity, and structure their content for usability.\nThis is an updated version of an article written by Jakob Nielsen in 2007.\nTabs are a fundamental and frequently used control in interface design. For decades, the humble tab has enabled designers to organize and facilitate content navigation. In that time, tabs subtly evolved from the classic file-folder paradigm that initially inspired them. These essential best practices will ensure your tabs do not introduce usability issues for your users.\n(This article discusses tabs found within the user interface and not those that allow\nusers to keep multiple pages open\nin the\nbrowser chrome\n.)\nIn This Article:\nWhat Are Tabs?\nWhen to Use Tabs\nTabs Versus Accordions\nTypes of Tabs\nTab Visual Design: Best Practices\nTab Content: Best Practices\nDiagnosing Design Problems with Tabs\nWhat Are Tabs?\nTabs\nallow users to selectively view a single panel of content from among a list of options.\nFrom a user experience perspective, a tab-based design includes the following elements:\nList:\nA (traditionally horizontal) list of the available tabs\nLabel:\nA concise description of the content found on that tab\nPanel:\nA panel displaying the selected tab\u2019s content\nSelection indicators:\nA visual signifier that marks which tab is displaying content\nClicking or tapping on the label selects the tab.\nTabs simplify interfaces by organizing and concealing content until requested by the user. Classic tab styling (top) evokes physical folders in a filing cabinet. Modern approaches (bottom) attempt to make tabs easier to integrate into layouts by reducing or eliminating the border strokes on the selected tab and its panel.\nA tab control contains a list of available tabs, short labels describing the tabs\u2019 content, one or more indicators marking the selected tab, and a panel displaying only the selected tab\u2019s content.\nIn addition to these common elements,\ncomplex applications\nmay contain other supplemental features to help users. These include:\nIcons (ideally\nthe icon should be accompanied by a label\n)\nAdding, closing, renaming, or copying tabs\nReordering tabs via drag and drop\nScrolling through the set of tabs if not all are visible on the screen (i.e., carousel-like tabs)\nWhen to Use Tabs\nWhen lengthy content has clear groupings\n. Tabs minimize\ncognitive load\nby\nchunking\ncontent into\nscannable\npieces instead of showing it all at once.\nWhen there are few content groupings\n. When the number of tabs overflows the tab list, the tab bar often becomes a carousel. As a result, the hidden tabs become less discoverable, and the\ninteraction cost\nneeded to access them increases, as users need to manipulate secondary controls to reveal those tabs. The fewer tabs, the better.\nPatagonia: A button appeared when the viewport was smaller than the tab list. Clicking the button horizontally scrolled the tab list to reveal additional tabs.\nWhen content has unequal importance\n. Tab controls select and display a tab by default. This default tab receives more attention from users, while the other tabs may be ignored. Ensure that the content within nondefault tabs is supplemental rather than critical for a successful user experience.\nWhen content can be labeled concisely\n. Short tab labels work best, as they conserve horizontal space in the tab list and avoid horizontal scrolling.\nWhen users don\u2019t need to simultaneously see information presented under different tabs\n. Otherwise, users must repeatedly switch between tabs to compare or reference information. In that situation, a tab-based design taxes users\u2019\nshort-term memory\n, increases cognitive load and interaction cost, and lowers usability compared to a design that puts everything on one big page.\n\u274c\nGoogle\u2019s ad-management site uses tabs to organize topics or brands used in advertising. The tabbed approach makes it hard for users to get a comprehensive view of ad content they may encounter and to set their preferences.\nTabs Versus Accordions\nLike tabs,\naccordions\nare another effective method for collapsing content. Accordions are particularly useful on mobile devices,\nwhere they work better than tabs due to the limited screen space\n. Accordions can utilize longer labels and work well to organize short pieces of content such as\nFAQs\n. On desktop, tabs may be preferable as accordions can make the page seem too empty when closed. Moreover, tabs can handle longer content and accommodate more complex layouts than accordions.\nTypes of Tabs\nIn-page tabs\norganize and present related content within a single page. These tabs are not for navigation but enable users to alter the content displayed in the panel. In-page tabs are the originator of the tab-design pattern.\nNavigation tabs\nenable users to navigate to different pages. Because navigation usability improves when the\nuser\u2019s location is clearly marked\n, designers started using the visual presentation of tabs (in particular, selection indicators) for navigation controls. Over time, this tab styling became a common visual approach to navigation.\nAlthough navigation and in-page tabs look alike, understanding the subtle differences between them is essential to implementing each effectively.\nNavigation Tabs\nIn-page Tabs\nContent\nBroad scope\nUnrelated\nDifferent\nNarrow scope\nRelated\nSimilar\nLocation\nTop or sometimes left of the viewport\nFrequently bottom on mobile\nVaries since they are embedded within the page layout\nScrolling Position\nSometimes fixed to the top (or bottom) of the viewport\nRarely fixed\nUser Expectations\nNavigating to a new view\nSlight loading delay\nRemaining in the current view\nInstantaneous loading\nDefault Selected Tab\nUsually one tab selected by default, but if the current page is not organized under any tab and was accessed elsewhere (like through a\nfooter\n), then no tab may be selected\nAlways one tab selected by default\nYahoo Finance: 3 layers of navigation tabs exposed several tiers of information architecture (\nFinance\n,\nVideos\n, and\nVideos\nsubcategories). The in-page tabs in the\nMarkets\nand\nProgram list\ncontainers enabled users to view types of content while remaining in place.\nDon\u2019t Mix and Match Tab Types\nMixing in-page and navigation tabs within one tab control will disorient users\n. In-page tabs should have similar content and keep users where they are. Navigation tabs should have dissimilar content and navigate users away from the current page.\n\u274c\nUnfortunately, this tab control found on a career-information page for the San Diego Wildlife Alliance mixed navigation and in-page tabs. Most of these tabs kept users on visually consistent pages that showcased different career details. The\nCareers Home\ntab\n,\nhowever, was an outlier. Clicking it led to a different page without the tabs. This design was unpredictable and likely prevented users from learning the site\u2019s organization.\nIn-page tabs are supposed to keep users on the same page while alternating between related views.\nThe intent is to reduce users' cognitive load by chunking content and\nprogressively disclosing\nit upon selection. Strictly speaking, each in-page tab should have the same layout but with different data.\n\u2705\nGoogle Finance: This page demonstrated a classic implementation of in-page tabs. It used two in-page tab lists for a line chart visualizing financial-market performance. The first in-page tab list displayed specific market categories (in this case,\nUS\nis selected), and the second tab list displayed a time scale (with the selected one being\n1D\n\u2014 1 day). The various tabs displayed different data consistently (as line charts) and users remained on the same page as they switched tabs.\nTabs Should All Look and Work the Same\nIn-page tabs and navigation tabs should be internally consistent (\nconsistency\nis a usability heuristic; it builds the user\u2019s feeling of\nmastery over the interface\n). For a given tab control, clicking on any of the tabs should change its panel, and they should use the same unselected and selected styling. Use a\ndesign system\nto promote this behavioral and visual consistency with your tab controls.\nWhen using in-page tabs and navigation tabs in the same experience, visually differentiate between these tab types to convey to users that they behave differently.\n\u274c\nBehance.com: This in-page tab had a\nCreatives for Hire\ntab that did not look or function like the other tabs; clicking it opened a different site in a new browser tab. The added icon attempted to convey this functionality difference, but this control is a link masquerading as a tab and should not be part of the tab control.\nTab Visual Design: Best Practices\nIndicate the Selected Tab\nProminently highlight the selected tab\n. There are a variety of selection indicators to convey this status:\nCommon region\n. This classic method for indicating the selected tab involves using the same background fills for the selected tab and the displayed panel. This tab fill should contrast with the background fill used for the other, unselected tabs. Today, designers and developers rarely use this technique as it introduces complexity in coordinating background fills across controls and page layouts.\nLines\n.\nInclude a horizontal line to underline the selected tab. Lines have become a popular choice because their layout is flexible. Do not use thin, single-pixel strokes or poor-contrast colors.\nFont styling\n. Change the text label of the selected tab to be bolded or to a different, darker color.\nSize\n. Resize the selected tab so it appears larger than the other tabs.\nIcon\n. Give the selected tab a distinct icon indicator not found on unselected tabs.\nUse at least two selection indicators to enhance the visual salience of the selected tab\n. Multiple indicators are critical to distinguish the selected tab when there are only two tabs, as there are fewer unselected tabs to compare against.\n\u2705\nCrateandbarrel.com: The selected tab was differentiated from the unselected tab using a common region and font styling.\n\u274c\nCNN: The selected navigation tab (in this case,\nTech) was\nbolded, but the effect was so subtle that it was nearly indistinguishable from the other tabs.\nMake Unselected Tabs Clearly Visible and Readable\nUnselected tabs should be visible to remind users of the additional options\n. Unselected tabs that are too faded into the background may not be noticeable, so users may never discover their content.\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\n\u274c\nMongoDB: Several navigation-tab controls were used to organize complex technical content. Unfortunately, the font styling of the unselected tabs, such as\nOverview\nand\nDependencies\n, had poor color contrast with the white background and could be mistaken for unselectable features.\nConnect the Selected Tab to Its Panel\nUsing a\ncommon region\nas a selection indicator is a visually powerful way to signal that the tab and its content are part of the same group. However, as mentioned above, this method is less used today.\nAnother way to convey the connection between the tab label and the tab panel is to use\nproximity\n. This approach is useful when the selected tab is highlighted using a different fill from its panel.\n\u274c\nPaneraBread.com: This tab found in the ordering flow was poorly connected to its panel. The yellow delivery tag, large amounts of padding, and the full-width line all separated and disassociated the\nDelivery\nlabel from its panel.\n\u2705\nmacOS: These in-page tabs organizing trackpad behavior didn\u2019t share a common region with their panel, but still maintained proximity despite their different background fills.\nUse Only One Row of Tabs\nWebsites and simple apps should avoid stacking tab lists within one tab control\n. Stacking arrangements increases the risk that a selection indicator (such as a line) is ambiguously positioned between several tab labels.\nStacking is also ineffective for tab styling that relies on a common region, as it requires repositioning the selected tab to be adjacent to its panel. This destroys\nspatial memory\nand makes it impossible for users to remember which tabs they have already visited.\n\u274c\nAmazon: These navigation tabs that were on Amazon\u2019s website from 2000 are a classic example illustrating the problems with stacking tabs. Clicking a tab in the back row (such as\nKitchen) forced a difficult\ndesign tradeoff\n:\nhighlight the tab in its back-row position but leave it disconnected from its panel, or move the tab to the front row to improve its proximity but rearrange the tab list ordering? Both options are undesirable from a usability perspective.\nPosition the Tab List Above the Panel\nVertical and bottom list arrangements will cause users to overlook the tabs\n. The visual design for in-page tabs should make the panel evident.\n\u274c\nOkta:\nThese overdesigned in-page tabs violated multiple best practices. The tabs were positioned to the right of the content panel and not at the top. The selected tab was differentiated only by a subtle shift in text color. There was no clear panel, as both the image and text were far apart. The tab labels were long. The blue line was equally spaced between different tabs, making distinguishing the selected tab difficult. Even worse \u2014 the blue line was animated and automatically selected the next tab after a few seconds!\n\u2705\nVanguard: These simply executed in-page tabs are positioned directly above their panel.\nTab Content: Best Practices\nArrange Tabs for Efficient Usage\nArrange tab content so high-use content is first in the list and selected by default. This maximizes visibility of frequently accessed content and lowers its interaction cost.\n\u2705\nSpotHero mobile app: This in-page tab organized parking-spot reservations by status. The\nUpcoming\nreservation tab was appropriately arranged first and selected by default, as users would likely be most interested in upcoming parking reservations interact. Past or cancelled reservations were available for reference.\nLogically Group Tab-Panel Content\nHow the content is perceived and used by users should inform how it is grouped\n.\nCard sorting\nis one option for researching this\nmini-IA\nproblem. If you don\u2019t find distinct groupings, tabs are likely the wrong interface control for managing your content. In such a case a single-page layout with subheadings would be more appropriate.\nUse Descriptive Tab Labels\nUsers should be able to predict what they\u2019ll find when selecting a tab\n. Since unselected tabs conceal their content, labels with strong\ninformation scent\nare crucial for users to engage with them. Use\nplain language\nrather than made-up marketing terms.\n\u274c\nVariety: An in-page tab list organized and previewed recent reviews.\nFilm\n,\nTV\n, and\nMusic\nwere short and apparent labels, but only an existing reader of Variety would recognize that the label\nLegit\nrepresented reviews of theater productions. This branded word has weaker\ninformation scent\nand probably less user engagement.\nWrite Short Tab Labels\nTab labels should usually be 1-2 words. Short labels are more scannable; if you need longer labels, it\u2019s a sign that the choices are too complicated for tabs.\nDo Not Use ALL CAPS for Tab Labels\nAll caps negatively impacts\nlegibility\n. Although\ntypography research\nsuggests that all-caps text may offer some glanceability improvements at small font sizes, this is more of a mitigation for smallness than a wise visual-design tactic to use broadly.\nBecause most text we interact with in daily life is mixed case, people are unaccustomed to scanning or reading all-caps text (and ephemeral design trends aren\u2019t going to change this). Better to pick one capitalization style (sentence- or title-case) and stick to it.\n\u274c\nPenguin Random House: These in-page tabs would have been more legible if their labels were not in all caps.\nMake Tab Features Findable\nComplex apps where users must manage their information space may need tab-management features (e.g., adding, copying, or deleting tabs). Indicate the presence of these features by embedding controls within the tab (but beware of\nquestionable icons\n). Monitor these features during\nusability testing\n, as they will not be familiar or findable to many users.\n\u274c\nMicrosoft Excel for Microsoft 365: Accessing tab-related commands such as renaming or deleting a worksheet (i.e., tab) required knowledge that right-clicking the tab would present these options in a menu, which could be challenging for novice users to find.\n\u2705\nGoogle Sheets:\nSplit buttons\nfor the tabs hinted that additional commands were available. Clicking the tab\u2019s arrow button revealed tab-related commands (unfortunately, this arrow button lacked a clear visual signifier: the button border displayed only when the cursor hovered over it). Right clicking the tab was an alternate way of opening this menu.\nDiagnosing Design Problems with Tabs\nTab-design problems are a common finding if you are using\nanalytics for a UX-health check\n. If you\u2019re tracking within-page actions, you may find users rarely use tabs on certain pages.\nCheck if you\u2019re violating any of this article\u2019s best practices. If yes, redesign your tabs and do a quick\nA/B test\nto check whether your redesign is better.\nRemember to check these\naccessibility considerations\nas well:\nKeyboard navigation\n: Ensure that tabs can be navigated and selected using the keyboard. Use Enter or Space to select a tab.\nFocus\n: Tabs should have high-contrast focus highlighting.\nARIA roles\n: Check with your developers whether appropriate ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles and properties are used to communicate tab structure to assistive technologies.\nConclusion\nIf you follow this article\u2019s best practices, users will know how to use your tabs without further exploration or error-prone guessing. Then, they can devote more time and energy to understanding the content and features available under these tabs\n.\nTabs seem boring, but when done right, they exemplify good UX design: users don\u2019t consciously think about the tabs themselves \u2014 they just work.\nNavigation,Design Patterns,Application Design,Web/UI Design,controls,interfaces\nRelated Topics\nNavigation\nNavigation\nDesign Patterns\nApplication Design\nLearn More:\nVertical Navigation\nPage Laubheimer\n\u00b7\n2 min\nNavigation Menus - 5 Tips to Make Them Visible\nKathryn Whitenton\n\u00b7\n3 min\nFooters Are Underrated\nTherese Fessenden\n\u00b7\n4 min\nRelated Articles:\nThe Negative Impact of Mobile-First Web Design on Desktop\nKim Flaherty,  Tim Neusesser, and  Nishi Chitale\n\u00b7\n11 min\nTable of Contents: The Ultimate Design Guide\nHuei-Hsin Wang and  Maddie Brown\n\u00b7\n14 min\nAccordions on Desktop: When and How to Use\nHuei-Hsin Wang\n\u00b7\n10 min\nKilling Off the Global Navigation: One Trend to Avoid\nJen Cardello and  Kathryn Whitenton\n\u00b7\n8 min\nIn-Page Links for Content Navigation\nHuei-Hsin Wang\n\u00b7\n8 min\nScrolljacking 101\nSara Paul\n\u00b7\n10 min",

In-page tabs should have similar content and keep users where they are. Navigation tabs should have dissimilar content and navigate users away from the current page.\n\n![Navigation and in-page tabs on the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance website, specifically on the Careers page.

It used two in-page tab lists for a line chart visualizing financial-market performance. The first in-page tab list displayed specific market categories (in this case,* US *is selected), and the second tab list displayed a time scale (with the selected one being* 1D *\u2014 1 day). The various tabs displayed different data consistently (as line charts) and users remained on the same page as they switched tabs.*\n\n### Tabs Should All Look and Work the Same\n\nIn-page tabs and navigation tabs should be internally consistent ([consistency](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/consistency-and-standards/) is a usability heuristic; it builds the user\u2019s feeling of [mastery over the interface](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ideologies-of-web-design/)). For a given tab control, clicking on any of the tabs should change its panel, and they should use the same unselected and selected styling. Use a [design system](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-systems-101/) to promote this behavioral and visual consistency with your tab controls.\n\nWhen using in-page tabs and navigation tabs in the same experience, visually differentiate between these tab types to convey to users that they behave differently.\n\n![The \u201cCreative Jobs\u201d section of the Behance website, emphasizing the navigation functionality of different tabs. At the top, a colorful banner with the text \u201cCreative Jobs\u201d invites users to explore career opportunities.

A blue annotation highlights that the \u201cFreelance\u201d and \u201cFull-Time\u201d tabs change the content displayed in the panel below when selected. A red annotation points out that the \u201cCreatives for Hire\u201d tab navigates to a new page rather than changing the panel content. Below the tabs, there is a search bar and listings for full-time jobs, including positions like \u201cSummer Internship\u201d and \u201cWebsite Manager.\u201d](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2024/07/05/behance.jpg)\n\n\u274c *Behance.com: This in-page tab had a* Creatives for Hire *tab that did not look or function like the other tabs; clicking it opened a different site in a new browser tab. The added icon attempted to convey this functionality difference, but this control is a link masquerading as a tab and should not be part of the tab control.*\n\n## Tab Visual Design: Best Practices\n\n### Indicate the Selected Tab\n\n**Prominently highlight the selected tab**. There are a variety of selection indicators to convey this status:\n\n- **Common region**. This classic method for indicating the selected tab involves using the same background fills for the selected tab and the displayed panel. This tab fill should contrast with the background fill used for the other, unselected tabs. Today, designers and developers rarely use this technique as it introduces complexity in coordinating background fills across controls and page layouts.\n- **Lines**.Include a horizontal line to underline the selected tab. Lines have become a popular choice because their layout is flexible. Do not use thin, single-pixel strokes or poor-contrast colors.\n- **Font styling**. Change the text label of the selected tab to be bolded or to a different, darker color.\n- **Size**. Resize the selected tab so it appears larger than the other tabs.\n- **Icon**. Give the selected tab a distinct icon indicator not found on unselected tabs.\n\n**Use at least two selection indicators to enhance the visual salience of the selected tab**. Multiple indicators are critical to distinguish the selected tab when there are only two tabs, as there are fewer unselected tabs to compare against.\n\n![A mobile view of the Crate & Barrel website, featuring a navigation menu with two tabs at the top: \u201cCrate&Barrel\u201d and \u201cCrate&kids.\u201d The \u201cCrate&Barrel\u201d tab is selected and blends seamlessly with the white background of the panel below it. A blue annotation points out the contrasting font fills between the two tabs, with the selected tab in black text on a white background and the unselected tab in white text on a black background. The red annotation highlights that the selected tab shares its white background fill with the main content panel. Below the tabs, a list of categories such as \u201cFurniture,\u201d \u201cOutdoor,\u201d \u201cTabletop & Bar,\u201d \u201cKitchen,\u201d \u201cBedding,\u201d and others is displayed, each with a plus icon to expand the category.](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2024/07/05/crateandbarrel.jpg)\n\n\u2705 *Crateandbarrel.com: The selected tab was differentiated from the unselected tab using a common region and font styling.*\n\n![A section of the CNN Business website, highlighting the navigation tabs.

Unfortunately, the font styling of the unselected tabs, such as* Overview *and* Dependencies*, had poor color contrast with the white background and could be mistaken for unselectable features.*\n\n### Connect the Selected Tab to Its Panel\n\nUsing a [common region](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/common-region/) as a selection indicator is a visually powerful way to signal that the tab and its content are part of the same group. However, as mentioned above, this method is less used today.\n\nAnother way to convey the connection between the tab label and the tab panel is to use [proximity](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/gestalt-proximity/). This approach is useful when the selected tab is highlighted using a different fill from its panel.\n\n![A mobile interface from Panera Bread\u2019s website, where users choose an order type. There are two tabs at the top: \u201cRapid Pick-Up\u201d and \u201cDelivery.\u201d The \u201cDelivery\u201d tab is selected, indicated by an underline and a tag showing \u201c$0 Delivery Fee.\u201d  A red annotation highlights that the large gap and the tag between the tab label and the panel weaken their visual relationship.

Stacking arrangements increases the risk that a selection indicator (such as a line) is ambiguously positioned between several tab labels.\n\nStacking is also ineffective for tab styling that relies on a common region, as it requires repositioning the selected tab to be adjacent to its panel. This destroys [spatial memory](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/spatial-memory/) and makes it impossible for users to remember which tabs they have already visited.\n\n![the header section of an older version of the Amazon.com website.

[Card sorting](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/card-sorting-how-many-users-to-test/) is one option for researching this [mini-IA](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mini-ia-structuring-information/) problem. If you don\u2019t find distinct groupings, tabs are likely the wrong interface control for managing your content. In such a case a single-page layout with subheadings would be more appropriate.\n\n### Use Descriptive Tab Labels\n\n**Users should be able to predict what they\u2019ll find when selecting a tab**. Since unselected tabs conceal their content, labels with strong [information scent](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/information-scent/) are crucial for users to engage with them. Use [plain language](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-writing-use-search-keywords/) rather than made-up marketing terms.\n\n![A section of the Variety website featuring entertainment reviews.

Short labels are more scannable; if you need longer labels, it\u2019s a sign that the choices are too complicated for tabs.\n\n### Do Not Use ALL CAPS for Tab Labels\n\nAll caps negatively impacts [legibility](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/legibility-readability-comprehension/). Although [typography research](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/glanceable-fonts/) suggests that all-caps text may offer some glanceability improvements at small font sizes, this is more of a mitigation for smallness than a wise visual-design tactic to use broadly.\n\nBecause most text we interact with in daily life is mixed case, people are unaccustomed to scanning or reading all-caps text (and ephemeral design trends aren\u2019t going to change this).

If you\u2019re tracking within-page actions, you may find users rarely use tabs on certain pages.\n\nCheck if you\u2019re violating any of this article\u2019s best practices. If yes, redesign your tabs and do a quick [A/B test](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/putting-ab-testing-in-its-place/) to check whether your redesign is better.\n\nRemember to check these [accessibility considerations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/) as well:\n\n- **Keyboard navigation**: Ensure that tabs can be navigated and selected using the keyboard. Use Enter or Space to select a tab.\n- **Focus**: Tabs should have high-contrast focus highlighting.\n- **ARIA roles**: Check with your developers whether appropriate ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles and properties are used to communicate tab structure to assistive technologies.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIf you follow this article\u2019s best practices, users will know how to use your tabs without further exploration or error-prone guessing. Then, they can devote more time and energy to understanding the content and features available under these tabs**.** Tabs seem boring, but when done right, they exemplify good UX design: users don\u2019t consciously think about the tabs themselves \u2014 they just work.\n\nNavigation,Design Patterns,Application Design,Web/UI Design,controls,interfaces\n\n## Related Topics\n\n- Navigation\n  [Navigation](/topic/navigation/)\n- [Design Patterns](/topic/design-patterns/)\n- [Application Design](/topic/applications/)\n\n## Learn More:\n\n- [![](https://media.nngroup.com/media/videos/thumbnails/Vertical_Navigation_Thumbnail_.jpg.650x364_q75_autocrop_crop-smart_upscale.jpg)\n\n  Vertical Navigation\n\n  Page Laubheimer\n  \u00b7\n  2 min](/videos/vertical-navigation/?lm=tabs-used-right&pt=article)\n- [![](https://media.nngroup.com/media/videos/thumbnails/Navigation_Menus_5_Tips_to_Make_Them_Visible_Thumbnail.jpg.650x364_q75_autocrop_crop-smart_upscale.jpg)\n\n  Navigation Menus - 5 Tips to Make Them Visible\n\n  Kathryn Whitenton\n  \u00b7\n  3 min](/videos/navigation-menu-visibility/?lm=tabs-used-right&pt=article)\n- [![](https://media.nngroup.com/media/videos/thumbnails/Footers_are_Underrated_Thumbnail.jpg.650x364_q75_autocrop_crop-smart_upscale.jpg)\n\n  Footers Are Underrated\n\n  Therese Fessenden\n  \u00b7\n  4 min](/videos/footers/?lm=tabs-used-right&pt=article)\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n- [The Negative Impact of Mobile-First Web Design on Desktop\n\n  Kim Flaherty, Tim Neusesser, and Nishi Chitale\n  \u00b7\n  11 min](/articles/content-dispersion/?lm=tabs-used-right&pt=article)\n- [Table of Contents: The Ultimate Design Guide\n\n  Huei-Hsin Wang and Maddie Brown\n  \u00b7\n  14 min](/articles/table-of-contents/?lm=tabs-used-right&pt=article)\n- [Accordions on Desktop: When and How to Use\n\n  Huei-Hsin Wang\n  \u00b7\n  10 min](/articles/accordions-on-desktop/?lm=tabs-used-right&pt=article)\n- [Killing Off the Global Navigation: One Trend to Avoid\n\n  Jen Cardello and Kathryn Whitenton\n  \u00b7\n  8 min](/articles/killing-global-navigation-one-trend-avoid/?lm=tabs-used-right&pt=article)\n- [In-Page Links for Content Navigation\n\n  Huei-Hsin Wang\n  \u00b7\n  8 min](/articles/in-page-links-content-navigation/?lm=tabs-used-right&pt=article)\n- [Scrolljacking 101\n\n  Sara Paul\n  \u00b7\n  10 min](/articles/scrolljacking-101/?lm=tabs-used-right&pt=article)",
