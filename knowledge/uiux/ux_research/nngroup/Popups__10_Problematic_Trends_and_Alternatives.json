I was reminded of this fact during a recent usability study. While attempting to complete a task, a participant tossed his phone across the table after encountering multiple popups, consecutively.

Several other users shared a similar sentiment, albeit they did not throw their phones.\nIn This Article:\nDifferent Types of Popups\nPopup Timing: Don\u2019t Prompt Before Interaction or During Critical Tasks\nPopup Context: Don\u2019t Impede Transitions or Access to Content\nPopup Content: Don\u2019t Assume a Modal Overlay Will Deliver the Message\nConclusion\nDifferent Types of Popups\nA\npopup\n(also known as an\noverlay\nor\npopover\n) is a window or\ndialog\nthat appears on top of the page content. A popup can be classified according to two dimensions:\n1.\u00a0 Whether the user can interact with the rest of the page:\nModal:\nthe content on the page is disabled until the user explicitly interacts with the overlay.\nNonmodal:\nusers can still interact with the background content (for example, by selecting links or tapping buttons) while the overlay remains visible.\n2.\u00a0 Whether the background is dimmed:\nIf the background is dimmed, the popup is called a\nlightbox.\nThere is no special name for the case when the background content is not visually dimmed.\nAlthough in many cases lightboxes are modal, that is not always true.\nIn terms of popup anatomy, modal overlays disable all background content, nonmodal overlays preserve users\u2019 ability to interact with background content, and lightboxes dim the background content.\nOver several weeks, I captured screenshots of every popup I encountered on websites and in mobile applications:\non average, 25 popups\nper week\n, which is more than any human being should have to endure (but is pretty representative of today\u2019s internet user experience). This experiment, together with my usability study, surfaced a myriad of bad implementation practices and was proof that\nthe\noveruse of overlays\nis far from over\n. We\u2019re nearing the point where websites have abused these elements so much that the problematic instances far outweigh the cases where popups remain a useful design tactic. In this article, I\u2019ll outline the issues I observed and discuss key factors to consider, along with realistic alternatives to\npopups\nthat preserve the organization\u2019s intent and the users\u2019 experience.\nPopup Timing: Don\u2019t Prompt Before Interaction or During Critical Tasks\n1. Showing a popup before the main page content loads:\nRegardless of the variation used, never show a popup before users can glean value from your website or application. This trend is highly intrusive because\nthe users\u2019 task is interrupted before they even land on the page.\nPeople have grown accustomed to seeing premature popups on websites and usually ignore them or immediately look for the fastest means by which to close the popup to return to their task. Popups that appear before the page loads make the site look desperate and the user experience feel frantic. Additionally, sites who fail to recognize these facts\nrisk low rankings in search-engine results\nas\nGoogle penalizes sites\nthat use practices which make content less accessible to users, especially on mobile.\nWhat to do instead:\nWait to present the content in the popup until it\u2019s contextually relevant to the user. Use the\nreciprocity principle\n: give value to your visitors before asking them anything \u2014 whether it\u2019s requesting an email address, or even the action of dismissing the popup. Run user testing to identify the context appropriate for whatever content you were planning to display in the popup and figure out the best way to display that content; in many cases it will not be in a popup. The only use case when it is acceptable to display any kind of popup before the page content loads is when your site is\nlegally obligated to request consent from users to accept the use of cookies or verify their age.\n(Though we wish that the EU and other regulatory authorities would embrace a less annoying interpretation of GDPR and similar rules.)\nHuffPost presented users with a lightbox before the main page content loaded. This is an acceptable use of an otherwise problematic practice, as the website is legally obliged to ask for consent when using personal data, including location.\n2. Displaying a popup right after the user logs in:\nA popup displayed right after the user logs in is just as bothersome as one shown before the page content loads. When users\nlog in to an account\n, they have a next step or subsequent task in mind \u2014 or else why would they have logged in?! Immediately presenting a popup of any kind will distract and impede them from completing their next step. Because they\u2019re focused on the next step, it\u2019s likely that users will pay no attention to the popup or abruptly close it. Not only that, but they may get frustrated by the interruption and by the extra time and\ninteraction cost\nrequired to close the popup or move it out of the way.\nWhat to do instead:\nGive users some time and space to complete their tasks after logging into their account and don\u2019t show popups right away. It\u2019s acceptable to eventually present helpful account tips, guidance, or new features after some time has gone by, but only if the user\u2019s task is enhanced or further supported by the content presented or by the new functionality. In these cases, always favor less intrusive methods such as\ntooltips\nand small, nonmodal overlays to communicate about these elements.\nGmail used a relatively unobtrusive nonmodal overlay to introduce a new feature that supported the user\u2019s current task of cleaning up the inbox. The nonmodal overlay appeared after the user interacted with the inbox, rather than immediately after login.\n3. Asking for an email address before interaction:\nMany sites and applications use popups to ask for the users\u2019 email address before they have even had a chance to interact with the content. Ecommerce, news websites and applications, as well as blogs were the biggest offenders in this category. This approach is problematic because not only will people be annoyed by the popup, its timing, and the fact that the site is asking for email addresses too soon, but they will also assume that the site will spam them with unwanted junk mail.\nFor example, one user who landed on Uncommon Goods\u2019 website became disgruntled when she was greeted by a modal overlay asking for her email address to get access to secret sales. She said, \u201cIt really annoys me when stuff like that pops up before I\u2019ve done anything else on the website. How do I know if I want to be an email subscriber if I just got here? I would prefer to get that a little later on.\u201d\nOne user became annoyed by Uncommon Goods\u2019 website when it displayed a modal overlay asking for her email address shortly after she arrived on the site.\nThere are many tradeoffs to consider when asking users for their email address. Sites and applications often use premature modals because of the short-term uptick in metrics they yield. However, short-term metrics often come at the price of frustrating many users who are not motivated by arbitrary incentives, such as secret sales.\nWhat to do instead:\nRather than showing email popups early on, think of when users might be most comfortable sharing their email addresses with you. Are they browsing a category which has an applicable promotional code? Or maybe they\u2019ve just read (or\nscanned\n) an entire blog post. These actions could be appropriate triggers for a minimally intrusive nonmodal overlay, which could appear close to the upper or lower right corner, and\nuse a sensible amount of screen space\n. Offer users something\nvaluable and\ntangible\nin exchange for their email address; don\u2019t just expect them to hand it over.\nMarkManson.net displayed a minimally intrusive nonmodal overlay after people had reached the bottom of a blog post. The popup also offered a free ebook as an incentive.\n4. Asking for feedback before people have done anything meaningful:\nReceiving feedback from your users is important, but you shouldn\u2019t flood people with\nfeedback prompts\nbefore they have done anything on your site. Sites and applications tend to present users with feedback popups right away in hopes that they\u2019ll give a high rating and move on with their tasks. Rarely does this happen; more often, users swiftly close the popup, with no intent to seek it out again.\nGetting meaningful feedback from your users at appropriate points in the experience provides insight into their\nchallenges and roadblocks\n.\nBut if you ask for feedback too soon, you risk not getting any when it matters most.\nFor example, while trying to pay a phone bill on ATT.com, a study participant became frustrated by a feedback modal that had appeared right as she landed on her bill. She said, \u201cWell, I would have given feedback after I paid my bill, but now I\u2019m frustrated that this is here and I haven\u2019t even done anything yet to give feedback on.\u201d\nA study participant begrudgingly closed a feedback modal while trying to pay her phone bill. She stated that she hadn\u2019t done anything on the site yet to warrant giving feedback.\nWhat to do instead:\nAsk users to\nprovide feedback immediately after they have completed a top task on your site.\nThis approach minimizes interruptions and ensures that the feedback will be based on an actual interaction. For example, the video-conferencing software BlueJeans asked users for feedback after a meeting concluded. This request did not display prematurely, but at a contextually relevant and appropriate time.\nAsk for feedback from users immediately after they\u2019ve completed key tasks, not immediately when they arrive on your site. This way, you increase the chance to receive relevant comments or ratings. Using a modal overlay in this case is less annoying and intrusive to the user.\n5. Interrupting users to ask for feedback during critical tasks:\nUsers hate being interrupted, yet examples of websites and applications that disturb users with feedback popups in the middle of completing critical tasks are abundant. Most of the time, giving feedback won\u2019t be the top reason for your users\u2019 visit, so don\u2019t disrupt people with popups in the middle of critical tasks either.\nThe United app displayed a modal overlay right in the middle of a critical task: retrieving a boarding pass.\nWhat to do instead:\nIn addition to asking users to provide feedback\nonly after critical tasks are completed\n, offer a static, nonintrusive means by which to give feedback, anytime they want. A tab on the side of the screen, a link in the footer, or a link in the navigation are all acceptable alternatives to disruptive modals and put the user in control of sharing their opinion when they\u2019re ready.\nNestle didn\u2019t interrupt users with a feedback modal, but included a feedback link in the site\u2019s footer.\nBritish Airways displayed a button labeled\nFeedback\non the right side of all its pages.\n6. Showing multiple popups one after another:\nDisplaying multiple popups on top of each other makes your site look unprofessional, desperate, and disorganized. It also overwhelms users and forces them to spend effort to close each one. If your site uses many different types of popups,\ntest the implementation\nto avoid presenting users with multiple popups at a time.\nWhat to do instead:\nIf you must present critical information (e.g.,\nimportant warnings\nto prevent or correct errors) in a popup, be sure to show only one at a time.\u00a0 Even better, don\u2019t show critical information in a popup, since people tend to close them without reading. Instead, use a visually distinct element and place it directly on the page, where the message best fits contextually. Ensure the copy clearly communicates exactly what the user needs to do to correct the issue and move forward.\nAt the end of the checkout flow, Lulus presented multiple feedback modals at the same time. A better approach would have been to show only one at a time or embed the feedback form on the confirmation page.\nCanva did a nice job of displaying critical information directly on the page. Instead of a popup, it used a visually distinct content module placed at the top. The messaging helped users understand what they needed to do to correct the issue.\nPopup Context: Don\u2019t Impede Transitions or Access to Content\n7. Displaying a modal overlay before the user moves to a new subdomain or external site:\nSome corporate websites link to content or applications that live on subdomains and external sites. Before users navigate away from the main site, a modal overlay appears to alert users of the impending transition. This type of popup is problematic because it overemphasizes the transition, making users feel lost and confused \u2014 especially if the subsites open in a new browser tab.\nDuring one of our usability-testing sessions, a participant who was looking for a job on HSBC\u2019s website encountered two different transitional modals when attempting a task that was essentially segmented across 3 separate websites. He said, \u201cWow, it keeps taking me to other websites, I don\u2019t even know where I am anymore. If their job application process is this complex and disjointed, I honestly don\u2019t think it would be a good place to work. It seems like a mess, no matter how nice this site looks.\u201d\nAfter clicking on Careers, a modal warned users that they were about to leave the initial site.\nOn the same website, users were shown yet another modal stating that they were going to a third website to apply for the job.\nWhat to do instead:\nRemove the modals, minimize the transitions between sites, and always\nretain navigation back to the main site\nwhen linking users to external properties. If your users do need to be warned when leaving your site,\nuse a less-intrusive option such as a tooltip on the link, to make the transition subtler.\nEli Lilly: Users were presented with an informative tooltip that let them know they were going to a different website. The tooltip helped users to remember where they were and where they were going.\n8. Interrupting access to content through modal overlays:\nA modal dialog that appears immediately after people have loaded an article or other piece of long-form content (such as that usually found in the\nAbout Us\nor\nNews\nsections of websites) makes it look as if the site is conditioning access to that content. This context is an especially bad place to be annoying because it diminishes credibility and trust. One user on CNN\u2019s mobile application grew frustrated when he encountered a newsletter modal right after landing on an article he wanted to read. He said, \u201cThis causes my suspicions of CNN to peak. Don\u2019t ask me for my email or to sign up for anything right away.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s mobile app displayed a modal right as the user landed on a page to read an article. This was problematic because signing up for CNN\u2019s newsletter was not why the user was there; reading the content was.\nWhat to do instead:\nAllow users to consume the content right away, without interruption. Replace the popup with a thin, easy-to-dismiss banner at the top of the page. This alternative to a popup will let the user self-serve if they want to subscribe to a newsletter, without blocking their main task of absorbing information.\nConde\u2019 Nast Traveller\u2019s website introduced its newsletter in a subtle and nonintrusive dismissible banner underneath the navigation. This design allowed interested users to subscribe to the newsletter, but did not distract those who just wanted to read the site\u2019s content.\nPopup Content: Don\u2019t Assume a Modal Overlay Will Deliver the Message\n9. Using modal overlays for GDPR and cookie notifications:\nUsers already dismiss modal overlays hastily as they assume nothing good will come of them. For communicating important information related to GDPR and the use of cookies, don\u2019t use modal overlays.\nWhat to do instead:\nFavor nonmodal overlays placed at the bottom or on the side of the page. These are far less intrusive and allow users to continue with their tasks. Make sure to provide enough information about how users\u2019 personal data is collected and used.\nReddit used a small, unobtrusive nonmodal overlay to ask users for cookie consent; however, language describing how people\u2019s data was used is overly vague.\nNNgroup.com used a nonmodal overlay with transparent language about cookie usage. We outlined exactly why we collect people\u2019s data and how it\u2019s specifically used to their benefit.\n10. Encouraging channel transitions in modal overlays without communicating a specific benefit:\nIt\u2019s common to see modals that encourage a channel transition from\nmobile websites to an associated mobile application\n\u2014 especially on\necommerce\nor news websites. These overlays are disruptive and problematic in many situations: often, web users are one-time users that have no interest in downloading an application for an occasional task.\nUnderstandably, organizations want to encourage application downloads, but a modal overlay is not the right approach for advertising your mobile app. Even users who have your app on their phone may be reluctant to switch channels out of fear of starting their process all over again.\u00a0 A modal overlay will only bother them.\nWhat to do instead:\nCreate awareness for your organization\u2019s mobile application, but not at the cost of intruding on the user\u2019s current task. Favor understated approaches such as a standard top banner and outline the benefits of using the app to ease people\u2019s transition to that channel.\nWayfair interrupted users with a generic modal which encouraged downloads of its mobile app. Users assumed that they would have to put in a lot of work to begin their task all over again on another channel, without a tangible benefit.\nMacy\u2019s did a good job of encouraging mobile app downloads from its mobile website.\u00a0 The nonmodal overlay at the bottom of the page contained an incentive for the channel transition and displayed user ratings for the app.\nConclusion\nPop, pop, it never stops.\nNot an acceptable user experience, so do stop the pops.\nGiven this overall conclusion, you may be wondering when it is acceptable to use popups; the answer is: sparingly.\nResist the urge to follow the crowd and don\u2019t inundate your users with interruptions to bolster short-term metrics.\nExplore alternative approaches that respect your users\u2019 needs and preserve your organization\u2019s intent of gathering feedback, notifying users of data collection, acquiring email addresses, or encouraging channel transitions.\nReserve the use of modal overlays for\ndelivering crucial information, only at appropriate times.\nDon\u2019t interrupt essential tasks or block relevant content with a big, intrusive popup. Conduct\nusability testing\nto make sure your popups don\u2019t frustrate your users and, as an added benefit, you\u2019ll get real insights to help you improve your overall experience.\nRelated Courses\nThe Human Mind and Usability\nUse psychology to predict and explain how your customers think and act\nInteraction\nWeb Page UX Design\nStrategically combine content, visuals, and interactive components to design successful web pages\nInteraction\nEmerging Patterns in Interface Design\nTrending UX patterns and their impact on the total user experience\nInteraction\npopups,Web Usability,Design Patterns,design mistakes,web trends\nRelated Topics\nWeb Usability\nWeb Usability\nDesign Patterns\nLearn More:\nEnable cookies\nto watch NN/g videos\nPopup Problems\nAnna Kaley\n\u00b7\n3 min\nTemplate Trap\nSarah Gibbons\n\u00b7\n6 min\nCheckbox Design: 8 Guidelines\nMaddie Brown\n\u00b7\n3 min\nButton States 101\nKelley Gordon\n\u00b7\n3 min\nRelated Articles:\nOverlay Overload: Competing Popups Are an Increasing Menace\nKate Moran\n\u00b7\n6 min\n10 Ways to Use Exit-Intent Popups to Improve UX\nKim Flaherty\n\u00b7\n9 min\nCancel vs Close: Design to Distinguish the Difference\nAurora Harley\n\u00b7\n6 min\nUser-Feedback Requests: 5 Guidelines\nAnna Kaley\n\u00b7\n10 min\nPassive Information Acquisition on the Increase\nFeifei Liu\n\u00b7\n9 min\nHow Information-Seeking Behavior Has Changed in 22 Years\nFeifei Liu\n\u00b7\n15 min",

This is an acceptable use of an otherwise problematic practice, as the website is legally obliged to ask for consent when using personal data, including location.*\n\n**2.

Asking for feedback before people have done anything meaningful:** Receiving feedback from your users is important, but you shouldn\u2019t flood people with [feedback prompts](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/keep-online-surveys-short/) before they have done anything on your site. Sites and applications tend to present users with feedback popups right away in hopes that they\u2019ll give a high rating and move on with their tasks. Rarely does this happen; more often, users swiftly close the popup, with no intent to seek it out again.\n\nGetting meaningful feedback from your users at appropriate points in the experience provides insight into their [challenges and roadblocks](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/seamless-cross-channel/). **But if you ask for feedback too soon, you risk not getting any when it matters most.** For example, while trying to pay a phone bill on ATT.com, a study participant became frustrated by a feedback modal that had appeared right as she landed on her bill. She said, \u201cWell, I would have given feedback after I paid my bill, but now I\u2019m frustrated that this is here and I haven\u2019t even done anything yet to give feedback on.\u201d\n\n![ATT Feedback Prompt](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2019/06/05/attfeedbackprompt.jpg)\n\n*A study participant begrudgingly closed a feedback modal while trying to pay her phone bill. She stated that she hadn\u2019t done anything on the site yet to warrant giving feedback.*\n\n**What to do instead:** Ask users to **provide feedback immediately after they have completed a top task on your site.** This approach minimizes interruptions and ensures that the feedback will be based on an actual interaction. For example, the video-conferencing software BlueJeans asked users for feedback after a meeting concluded. This request did not display prematurely, but at a contextually relevant and appropriate time.\n\n![BlueJeans Feedback Prompt](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2019/06/05/bluejeansfeedbackprompt.jpg)\n\n*Ask for feedback from users immediately after they\u2019ve completed key tasks, not immediately when they arrive on your site. This way, you increase the chance to receive relevant comments or ratings. Using a modal overlay in this case is less annoying and intrusive to the user.*\n\n**5. Interrupting users to ask for feedback during critical tasks:** Users hate being interrupted, yet examples of websites and applications that disturb users with feedback popups in the middle of completing critical tasks are abundant. Most of the time, giving feedback won\u2019t be the top reason for your users\u2019 visit, so don\u2019t disrupt people with popups in the middle of critical tasks either.\n\n![United Feedback Prompt During Boarding Pass Download](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2019/06/05/unitedpromptduringboardingpass.jpg)\n\n*The United app displayed a modal overlay right in the middle of a critical task: retrieving a boarding pass.*\n\n**What to do instead:** In addition to asking users to provide feedback **only after critical tasks are completed**, offer a static, nonintrusive means by which to give feedback, anytime they want. A tab on the side of the screen, a link in the footer, or a link in the navigation are all acceptable alternatives to disruptive modals and put the user in control of sharing their opinion when they\u2019re ready.\n\n![Nestle feedback link in footer.](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2019/06/05/nestlefeedbacklink2.jpg)\n\n*Nestle didn\u2019t interrupt users with a feedback modal, but included a feedback link in the site\u2019s footer.*\n\n![British Airways feedback link on the right side of the page](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2019/06/05/britishairwaysfeedbacklink2.jpg)\n\n*British Airways displayed a button labeled* Feedback *on the right side of all its pages.*\n\n**6. Showing multiple popups one after another:** Displaying multiple popups on top of each other makes your site look unprofessional, desperate, and disorganized. It also overwhelms users and forces them to spend effort to close each one. If your site uses many different types of popups, **test the implementation** to avoid presenting users with multiple popups at a time.\n\n**What to do instead:** If you must present critical information (e.g., [important warnings](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/confirmation-dialog/) to prevent or correct errors) in a popup, be sure to show only one at a time.\u00a0 Even better, don\u2019t show critical information in a popup, since people tend to close them without reading. Instead, use a visually distinct element and place it directly on the page, where the message best fits contextually. Ensure the copy clearly communicates exactly what the user needs to do to correct the issue and move forward.\n\n![LuLus showed multiple popups on top of each other.](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2019/06/05/lulusmultiplepopups.jpg)\n\n*At the end of the checkout flow, Lulus presented multiple feedback modals at the same time. A better approach would have been to show only one at a time or embed the feedback form on the confirmation page.*\n\n![Canva displayed critical information right on the page. ](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2019/06/05/canvacriticalinformation.jpg)\n\n*Canva did a nice job of displaying critical information directly on the page. Instead of a popup, it used a visually distinct content module placed at the top. The messaging helped users understand what they needed to do to correct the issue.*\n\n## Popup Context: Don\u2019t Impede Transitions or Access to Content\n\n**7. Displaying a modal overlay before the user moves to a new subdomain or external site:** Some corporate websites link to content or applications that live on subdomains and external sites. Before users navigate away from the main site, a modal overlay appears to alert users of the impending transition. This type of popup is problematic because it overemphasizes the transition, making users feel lost and confused \u2014 especially if the subsites open in a new browser tab.\n\nDuring one of our usability-testing sessions, a participant who was looking for a job on HSBC\u2019s website encountered two different transitional modals when attempting a task that was essentially segmented across 3 separate websites. He said, \u201cWow, it keeps taking me to other websites, I don\u2019t even know where I am anymore. If their job application process is this complex and disjointed, I honestly don\u2019t think it would be a good place to work. It seems like a mess, no matter how nice this site looks.\u201d\n\n![HSBC popup alerting users of going to another site. ](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2019/06/05/hsbc1.jpg)\n\n*After clicking on Careers, a modal warned users that they were about to leave the initial site.*\n\n![HSBC shows yet another popup warning users about going to a new site.](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2019/06/05/hsbc2.jpg)\n\n*On the same website, users were shown yet another modal stating that they were going to a third website to apply for the job.*\n\n**What to do instead:** Remove the modals, minimize the transitions between sites, and always [retain navigation back to the main site](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/universal-navigation/) when linking users to external properties. If your users do need to be warned when leaving your site, **use a less-intrusive option such as a tooltip on the link, to make the transition subtler.**\n\n![Eli Lilly tooltip](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2019/06/05/elilillytooltip.jpg)\n\n*Eli Lilly: Users were presented with an informative tooltip that let them know they were going to a different website. The tooltip helped users to remember where they were and where they were going.*\n\n**8. Interrupting access to content through modal overlays:**\u00a0 A modal dialog that appears immediately after people have loaded an article or other piece of long-form content (such as that usually found in the [*About Us*](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/about-us-information-on-websites/?) or [*News*](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/online-press-releases-and-news/) sections of websites) makes it look as if the site is conditioning access to that content. This context is an especially bad place to be annoying because it diminishes credibility and trust. One user on CNN\u2019s mobile application grew frustrated when he encountered a newsletter modal right after landing on an article he wanted to read. He said, \u201cThis causes my suspicions of CNN to peak. Don\u2019t ask me for my email or to sign up for anything right away.\u201d\n\n![CNN mobile app interrupts users with a popup.](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2019/06/05/cnnmobileapp2.jpg)\n\n*CNN\u2019s mobile app displayed a modal right as the user landed on a page to read an article. This was problematic because signing up for CNN\u2019s newsletter was not why the user was there; reading the content was.*\n\n**What to do instead:** Allow users to consume the content right away, without interruption. Replace the popup with a thin, easy-to-dismiss banner at the top of the page. This alternative to a popup will let the user self-serve if they want to subscribe to a newsletter, without blocking their main task of absorbing information.\n\n![Conde Nast uses a nonintrusive email signup.](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2019/06/05/condenast.jpg)\n\n*Conde\u2019 Nast Traveller\u2019s website introduced its newsletter in a subtle and nonintrusive dismissible banner underneath the navigation. This design allowed interested users to subscribe to the newsletter, but did not distract those who just wanted to read the site\u2019s content.*\n\n## Popup Content: Don\u2019t Assume a Modal Overlay Will Deliver the Message\n\n**9. Using modal overlays for GDPR and cookie notifications:** Users already dismiss modal overlays hastily as they assume nothing good will come of them. For communicating important information related to GDPR and the use of cookies, don\u2019t use modal overlays.\n\n**What to do instead:** Favor nonmodal overlays placed at the bottom or on the side of the page. These are far less intrusive and allow users to continue with their tasks. Make sure to provide enough information about how users\u2019 personal data is collected and used.\n\n![Reddit uses vague cookie consent copy. ](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2019/06/05/redditcookies2.jpg)\n\n*Reddit used a small, unobtrusive nonmodal overlay to ask users for cookie consent; however, language describing how people\u2019s data was used is overly vague.*\n\n![NN/g uses much clearer and transparent cookie consent copy.](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2019/06/05/nngcookies.jpg)\n\n*NNgroup.com used a nonmodal overlay with transparent language about cookie usage. We outlined exactly why we collect people\u2019s data and how it\u2019s specifically used to their benefit.*\n\n**10. Encouraging channel transitions in modal overlays without communicating a specific benefit:** It\u2019s common to see modals that encourage a channel transition from [mobile websites to an associated mobile application](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mobile-native-apps/) \u2014 especially on [ecommerce](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ecommerce-expectations/) or news websites. These overlays are disruptive and problematic in many situations: often, web users are one-time users that have no interest in downloading an application for an occasional task.\n\nUnderstandably, organizations want to encourage application downloads, but a modal overlay is not the right approach for advertising your mobile app. Even users who have your app on their phone may be reluctant to switch channels out of fear of starting their process all over again.\u00a0 A modal overlay will only bother them.\n\n**What to do instead:** Create awareness for your organization\u2019s mobile application, but not at the cost of intruding on the user\u2019s current task. Favor understated approaches such as a standard top banner and outline the benefits of using the app to ease people\u2019s transition to that channel.\n\n![Wayfair interrupted users with a popup for their app.](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2019/06/05/wayfairapppopup.jpg)\n\n*Wayfair interrupted users with a generic modal which encouraged downloads of its mobile app. Users assumed that they would have to put in a lot of work to begin their task all over again on another channel, without a tangible benefit.*\n\n![Macy's popup for its app was much less intrusive.](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2019/06/05/macysapppopup.jpg)\n\n*Macy\u2019s did a good job of encouraging mobile app downloads from its mobile website.\u00a0 The nonmodal overlay at the bottom of the page contained an incentive for the channel transition and displayed user ratings for the app.*\n\n## Conclusion\n\n*Pop, pop, it never stops.* Not an acceptable user experience, so do stop the pops.\n\nGiven this overall conclusion, you may be wondering when it is acceptable to use popups; the answer is: sparingly. **Resist the urge to follow the crowd and don\u2019t inundate your users with interruptions to bolster short-term metrics.** Explore alternative approaches that respect your users\u2019 needs and preserve your organization\u2019s intent of gathering feedback, notifying users of data collection, acquiring email addresses, or encouraging channel transitions.\n\nReserve the use of modal overlays for **delivering crucial information, only at appropriate times.** Don\u2019t interrupt essential tasks or block relevant content with a big, intrusive popup. Conduct [usability testing](https://www.nngroup.com/courses/usability-testing/) to make sure your popups don\u2019t frustrate your users and, as an added benefit, you\u2019ll get real insights to help you improve your overall experience.\n\n## Related Courses\n\n- [#### The Human Mind and Usability\n\n  Use psychology to predict and explain how your customers think and act\n\n  Interaction](/courses/human-mind/?lm=popups&pt=article)\n- [#### Web Page UX Design\n\n  Strategically combine content, visuals, and interactive components to design successful web pages\n\n  Interaction](/courses/web-page-design/?lm=popups&pt=article)\n- [#### Emerging Patterns in Interface Design\n\n  Trending UX patterns and their impact on the total user experience\n\n  Interaction](/courses/emerging-patterns-interface-design/?lm=popups&pt=article)\n\npopups,Web Usability,Design Patterns,design mistakes,web trends\n\n## Related Topics\n\n- Web Usability\n  [Web Usability](/topic/web-usability/)\n- [Design Patterns](/topic/design-patterns/)\n\n## Learn More:\n\n[![Popup Problems](https://media.nngroup.com/media/videos/thumbnails/Popup_Problems_Thumbnail.jpg.1300x728_q75_autocrop_crop-smart_upscale.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICfoXRRHTC0 \"Popup Problems on YouTube (new window)\")\n\nEnable cookies\n\u00a0to watch NN/g videos\n\nPopup Problems\n\n Anna Kaley\n\u00b7\n3 min\n\n- [![](https://media.nngroup.com/media/videos/thumbnails/Template_Trap_Thumbnail.jpg.650x364_q75_autocrop_crop-smart_upscale.jpg)\n\n  Template Trap\n\n  Sarah Gibbons\n  \u00b7\n  6 min](/videos/template-trap/?lm=popups&pt=article)\n- [![](https://media.nngroup.com/media/videos/thumbnails/Checkbox_Design_8_Guidelines_Thumbnail.jpg.650x364_q75_autocrop_crop-smart_upscale.jpg)\n\n  Checkbox Design: 8 Guidelines\n\n  Maddie Brown\n  \u00b7\n  3 min](/videos/checkbox-design-guidelines/?lm=popups&pt=article)\n- [![](https://media.nngroup.com/media/videos/thumbnails/Button_States_Thumbnail.jpg.650x364_q75_autocrop_crop-smart_upscale.jpg)\n\n  Button States 101\n\n  Kelley Gordon\n  \u00b7\n  3 min](/videos/button-states-101/?lm=popups&pt=article)\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n- [Overlay Overload: Competing Popups Are an Increasing Menace\n\n  Kate Moran\n  \u00b7\n  6 min](/articles/overlay-overload/?lm=popups&pt=article)\n- [10 Ways to Use Exit-Intent Popups to Improve UX\n\n  Kim Flaherty\n  \u00b7\n  9 min](/articles/exit-intent-good-ux/?lm=popups&pt=article)\n- [Cancel vs Close: Design to Distinguish the Difference\n\n  Aurora Harley\n  \u00b7\n  6 min](/articles/cancel-vs-close/?lm=popups&pt=article)\n- [User-Feedback Requests: 5 Guidelines\n\n  Anna Kaley\n  \u00b7\n  10 min](/articles/user-feedback/?lm=popups&pt=article)\n- [Passive Information Acquisition on the Increase\n\n  Feifei Liu\n  \u00b7\n  9 min](/articles/passive-information-acquisition/?lm=popups&pt=article)\n- [How Information-Seeking Behavior Has Changed in 22 Years\n\n  Feifei Liu\n  \u00b7\n  15 min](/articles/information-seeking-behavior-changes/?lm=popups&pt=article)",
