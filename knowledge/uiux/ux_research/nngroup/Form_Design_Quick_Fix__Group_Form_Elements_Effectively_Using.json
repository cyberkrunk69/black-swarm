Users should be able to complete forms quickly and without confusion. The following two tips show how using white space effectively will help reduce users' response time and the effort spent to determine what information is required where.\nIn This Article:\nTip #1: Place the label closer to the associated text field than to other text fields.\nTip #2: Group together related fields.\nA Note on Label Alignment\nConclusion\nTip #1: Place the label closer to the associated text field than to other text fields.\nIn the form above, the spacing between the label and the corresponding field makes it difficult to determine what to enter where. We often see this mistake in form design. Just remember this principle:\nitems near each other appear related\n.\nAs you can see below, by placing the field labels close to the corresponding fields, we\u2019ve increased your confidence in filling out each element.\nThis principle of placing related items closer to each other isn't new; it's actually the\nLaw of Proximity\nfrom Gestalt psychology. Gestalt psychologists were concerned with how and why the brain perceives an object as a whole rather than as a sum of individual parts. They came up with a several laws explaining how people organize visual information; the Law of Proximity was one of these.\nIn the next image, how many groups do you see?\nInstead of seeing 20 individual dots, we see two groups: one of 12 dots and one of 8. This is a shortcut our brain takes when processing visual information and is in fact another example of the Law of Proximity.\u00a0Based on the same Gestalt principle,\nusers might overlook other interface elements if they are placed too far from the object they act on\n.\nTip #2: Group together related fields.\nLong forms, with many fields, can feel overwhelming. Grouping related fields together helps users make sense of the information that they must fill in. For example, the name and the date of birth could be\nPersonal Information\n, while the address and the phone number could form the group\nContact Information\n.\nHere\u2019s what Tip #2 looks like in practice: Compare the signup form from Walgreens on the left to our version on the right.\nThe recreated Walgreens.com registration form (right) is easier to complete than the original (left) because related fields are grouped together, making it seem like 3 short forms.\nIncreasing the white space between form elements makes this 15-field form less overwhelming and therefore more likely to be completed. Users now see a 3-part form with 4\u20136 fields. You don\u2019t\nneed\ngroup headings, but they can help provide context.\nA Note on Label Alignment\nIn the Walgreens example above, the field labels are correctly placed close to the text fields; however, the right-aligned labels make it more difficult to scan the form, for the same reasons for which\nright-aligned menu items impede scannability\n.\nWe recommend placing\nfield labels above the corresponding text fields\n. Although this increases the form's overall length, it makes the form easier to scan, because users can see the text field in the same fixation as the label. Top placement also allows for longer field labels, as horizontal space isn't an issue.\nIf form length is a concern, you can place field labels to the left of the text fields. However, make sure that labels are of similar length and are placed as close to the text fields as possible. If the labels are too far to the left, it can be difficult to associate the correct label with its corresponding field, as in the following donation form from the San Diego Zoo.\u00a0(More about\ndesign for online donations\n.)\nIt is difficult to determine what information to enter in each field on the San Diego Zoo donation form, because field labels are placed too far from the corresponding text field.\nYou might be wondering, \"if proximity is such a problem, then\nwhy not place the labels inside the text fields?\n\". Don't be tempted. When you place the labels inside the text field as filler text, the label disappears when users input their text and they must remember it as they fill in the field. This especially causes an issue if users use the\nTab\nkey to move through a form. When they tab to the next field without looking, they will miss what information is required. Also, users are drawn to open text fields; they might mistake the filler text as a default answer and skip that form element.\nConclusion\nUsers can be hesitant to fill out forms online, so you want to make this process as easy as possible. Minor changes \u2014 such as using white space effectively to group related fields and indicating what information goes in each field \u2014 can significantly increase form usability.\nRelated Courses\nApplication Design for Web and Desktop\nComponents, design patterns, workflows, and ways of interacting with complex data\nInteraction\ngestalt,forms,Application Design,Human Computer Interaction,Visual Design\nRelated Topics\nApplication Design\nApplication Design\nHuman Computer Interaction\nVisual Design\nLearn More:\nCommon Region: Gestalt Principle for User Interface Design\nRachel Krause\n\u00b7\n3 min\nFigure/Ground: Gestalt Principle for User Interface Design\nSamhita Tankala\n\u00b7\n3 min\nContinuation: Gestalt Principle for User Interface Design\nMegan Brown\n\u00b7\n3 min\nRelated Articles:\nCloseness of Actions and Objects in GUI Design\nJakob Nielsen\n\u00b7\n3 min\nA Checklist for Designing Mobile Input Fields\nRaluca Budiu\n\u00b7\n2 min\nRadio Buttons: Select One by Default or Leave All Unselected?\nKara Pernice\n\u00b7\n12 min\nForms vs. Applications\nJakob Nielsen\n\u00b7\n6 min\nPlaceholders in Form Fields Are Harmful\nKatie Sherwin\n\u00b7\n6 min\nDark Mode vs. Light Mode: Which Is Better?\nRaluca Budiu\n\u00b7\n10 min",
