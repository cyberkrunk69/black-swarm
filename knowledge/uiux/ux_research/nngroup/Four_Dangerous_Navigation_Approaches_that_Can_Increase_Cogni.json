The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.\nMuch of our decision making and daily operations are dictated by System 1. System 2, being the \u201cEffortful System\u201d prefers to be used much less frequently.

Overly incremented sliders: \"Fun\" tools that become obstacles\nKeep an Eye Out for Cognitive Strain\nCognitive Ease and Cognitive Strain\nEvery moment, a person's brain is running diagnostics to determine if it can continue using System 1 or if it needs to tap into System 2. If all is well and running as expected, we are in a state of cognitive ease.\nIf we feel uneasy, uncertain, and/or sense a problem, we engage System 2 and switch to a state of cognitive strain\n.\nNumerous psychological studies (a number of which are described in great detail in\nThinking, Fast and Slow\n) have identified various stimuli that cause us to switch from cognitive ease to cognitive strain. For example, reading complicated instructions, listening to simultaneous conversations, viewing text that is in a small font or has poor contrast, and even being in a bad mood all generate cognitive strain. When user experience specialists facilitate usability studies, they observe people reacting to website and application designs. They watch body language and listen for changes in tone of voice and tenor of comments as participants think aloud. In effect, facilitators determine when participants move into a state of cognitive strain and what the stimulus may be.\nNegative Consequences\nIn many of our studies, we have witnessed that when people have to exert more energy in order to find a piece of information or manipulate a feature, they can become more vigilant and suspicious. Instead of just putting an item in the shopping cart and flying through the checkout, they may want to examine other options \u2014 some of which may not be on your site. They may start to question the credibility of your content, the reputation of your company, and the honesty of consumer reviews. The result of this lack of confidence may be a decrease in your visitors taking the actions you want them to take (a.k.a. desirable actions).\nFour Navigation Attributes/Components that Cause Strain\nThe following examples are from independent studies we have conducted in the past 5 years. To their credit, each of these sites have removed the strain-inducing navigation attributes, and we\u2019d like to believe it\u2019s because (1) they have awesome UX teams, and (2) they conducted usability testing and found the same issues that we point out here.\n1. Thin, horizontal, roll-over activated menus: Testing users\u2019 fine motor control (and patience)\nWhen I am teaching our\ncourse on Navigation Design\n, I like to joke that I\u2019ve asked my colleagues to stop sending me videos of study participants struggling with this style of navigation, because I\u2019ve already got quite the collection. Thin, horizontal, roll-over activated submenus are simply difficult for people to use \u2014 especially if the item they want is at the far end of the submenu. This is because they need to keep their cursor within the area of the submenu or else the choices disappear. The thinner and longer the menu, the more coordination and concentration is required to avoid accidentally dismissing it.\nOn Keurig\u2019s site, the participant was trying to access the\ne-Gift Certificates\nlink. It took her 6 times to select the link, because she had to keep the menu active and visible by maintaining a perfectly horizontal scroll without wandering off the trigger area. This ended up becoming a test of her motor skills instead of a navigation tool! People should not have to dedicate this much mental (and physical) effort to navigate.\nwww.keurig.com\n(circa 2009)\nAdvocates of this type of menu argue that users don\u2019t want the content in the body of the page to be covered by the exposed menu. However, in this example, the only content that would be covered would be the images in the hero space. Also, when people decide to activate a menu, they seek routing options and rarely need the body content visible (especially a hero image) in order to make an informed selection.\nFixed:\nThe site now features a\nwell-structured mega-menu\nthat does not require excessive motor effort to use.\nwww.keurig.com\n(circa 2013)\n2. Unfamiliar labels: Forcing translation of your creative nomenclature\nCatchy, unique labels may seem attractive, but unfamiliar terminology can actually drive users away. In the Dale Carnegie example below,\nInquire\n,\nInvolve\n,\nInnovate\n, and\nImpact\nare steps to help define training methods for their clients, but prospects don\u2019t know that. Using those labels as navigation tabs may seem like a good idea to everyone in the company, but outsiders need to know the process before the \u201cI\u201d words have any meaning.\nwww.dalecarnegie.com\n(circa 2010)\nRemember:\nYour methodologies, ad campaigns, and slogans may change. You should never use nomenclature tied to these as organizing elements in your information architecture and navigation labels. Defining your IA is exceptionally difficult when you are limited to a pre-defined set of high-level labels. It\u2019s like jamming a square peg in a round hole.\nFixed:\nThe site now features a page defining the process and the \u201cI\u201d terms are no longer used as navigation buttons.\nwww.dalecarnegie.com\n(circa 2013)\n3. Redundant links on routing pages: Increasing the perceived number of choices\nCornell University\u2019s Johnson School website was tested as part of our eyetracking study in 2010. The body of this routing page was well structured, containing links with succinct descriptions that explained the resulting content. However, the links in the left-hand submenu were repeats of the links in the body of the page. When people were evaluating link options, they had twice as many choices to scan because they didn't know these were redundant until they had committed the time to fixate on and read them.\nwww.johnson.cornell.edu\n(circa 2010)\nThere is a prevailing belief that duplicating links is not harmful, but it is.\nDesigners know these links are duplicates, but users do not\n. So, they often end up scanning both sets of links \u2014 effectively doubling the amount of analysis they need to conduct to select the best link.\nRepeating links burdens your visitors\n.\nFixed:\nThe site no longer repeats the same links in the page body and the left-hand submenu.\nwww.johnson.cornell.edu\n(circa 2013)\n4. Overly incremented sliders: \"Fun\" tools that become obstacles\nFor a while, everyone wanted sliders on their sites. In many cases, they are simply unnecessary. In Samsung\u2019s case, there were only 28 televisions in the\nPlasma TV\nsection, but the sliders \u2014 adjustable for the start and end ranges for both price and screen size \u2014 featured increments for which there were no matches. Also, there was no indication of which ranges would be fruitful.\nwww.samsung.com/au\n(circa 2012)\nWhen we tested Samsung\u2019s site, one participant looked at the\nfaceted search\nsliders and said, \u201cThat is actually quite a good feature.\" He then spent almost 2 minutes of great effort manipulating all 4 end points of the sliders to get some results. He wasn't successful and most of his attempts resulted in the \u201cSorry\u201d screen. In this case, sliders were an effortful overkill.\nFixed:\nThe most recent version has removed the faceted search altogether, because there simply aren\u2019t enough products to warrant it. Instead, people can use the filters above the listings.\nwww.samsung.com/au\n(circa 2013)\nKeep an Eye Out for Cognitive Strain\nCognitive strain is noticeable when you are watching people interact with an interface; that\u2019s why we always recommend some type of moderated testing as part of your research, measurement, and monitoring activities. Recognizing and replacing design elements that\nrequire too much effort from your users\ncan offer tremendous bottom-line value to your organization.\nLearn more in our full-day\nNavigation Design\ntraining course\n.\nNavigation,Persuasive Design,complexity\nRelated Topics\nNavigation\nNavigation\nPersuasive Design\nLearn More:\nVertical Navigation\nPage Laubheimer\n\u00b7\n2 min\nNavigation Menus - 5 Tips to Make Them Visible\nKathryn Whitenton\n\u00b7\n3 min\nFooters Are Underrated\nTherese Fessenden\n\u00b7\n4 min\nRelated Articles:\nThe Same Link Twice on the Same Page: Do Duplicates Help or Hurt?\nHoa Loranger\n\u00b7\n7 min\nStop Shaming Your Users for Micro Conversions\nKate Moran and  Kim Flaherty\n\u00b7\n5 min\nUsing the Title Attribute to Help Users Predict Where They Are Going\nJakob Nielsen\n\u00b7\n3 min\nCentered Logos Hurt Website Navigation\nKathryn Whitenton\n\u00b7\n7 min\nReduce Redundancy: Decrease Duplicated Design Decisions\nJakob Nielsen\n\u00b7\n3 min\nCounterfeit or Credible?
