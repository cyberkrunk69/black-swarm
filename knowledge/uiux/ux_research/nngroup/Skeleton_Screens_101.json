This progress indicator is used for full page loads and reduces the perception of a long loading time by providing clues for how the page will ultimately look.\nA skeleton screen is a design pattern used to indicate that a page is loading while providing users with a\nwireframe\n-like visual that mimics the layout of the page. This specific type of\nprogress indicator\nis used exclusively for full-page loads.\nLinkedIn uses a skeleton screen to indicate that the page is loading and to give users a sense of how the page will be structured.\nIn This Article:\nWhat Are the Different Types of Skeleton Screens?\nStatic-Content and -Image Skeleton Screens\nAnimated Skeleton Screens\nFrame-Display Skeleton Screens\nBenefits of Using Skeleton Screens\nAre Skeleton Screens Better than Progress Bars or Spinners?\nConclusion\nReferences\nWhat Are the Different Types of Skeleton Screens?\nThere are 3 main types of skeleton screens:\nStatic-content and -image skeleton screens\nAnimated skeleton screens\nFrame-display skeleton screens\nStatic-Content and -Image Skeleton Screens\nThese are the most common skeleton screens and look like wireframes, in which the light gray boxes represent\ncontent\nand images. The structure of the gray boxes mimics the structure of the final page with content. The skeleton screen helps users build a\nmental model\nof what will be on the page and even gives some clues as to the underlying information hierarchy.\nHeadspace uses a skeleton screen to build users\u2019 expectations for the structure of the page. This skeleton screen relies on design conventions, with large gray boxes representing images and long rectangle boxes representing text. The thickest gray line at the top (1) implies a page title, with a smaller secondary line underneath that would be descriptive text (2); below that, the page is structured into a sequence map (3) with a card at each step.\u00a0 In each card there will be a title (4), a bit of accompanying text (5), and an image (6). On the right you can see what the fully loaded page actually looks like.\nAnimated Skeleton Screens\nSome skeleton screens include\nanimations\nin the form of a pulsating movement, with the use of gradients or elements fading in and out. These are similar to wait animations (or spinners) and signify that the system is still working and still loading content, decreasing users\u2019 perception of a long loading time by keeping users engaged on the content being loaded.\nNote that animations of this sort can potentially be\ndistracting\n, annoying, or even create\naccessibility problems\nfor some users.\nDoorDash uses a short, animated skeleton screen in the form of a shimmer that moves from left to right.\nFrame-Display Skeleton Screens\nOne variation that we do not recommend is a skeleton screen that displays only the frame of the application without a content wireframe. These minimal skeleton screens only include the header, footer, and the background. This style doesn\u2019t include placeholders of the content, and as a result, doesn\u2019t give users a sense of the general structure of the page. A frame display is not recommended because, if users are forced to wait for too long, they will assume the page isn\u2019t working because the screen is mostly blank.\nNBC displays only the frame of the page, with a pulsing background gradient used \u00a0to communicate that the page is loading. However, this skeleton screen is essentially equivalent to a\nspinner\n, since it doesn\u2019t include any information about the page structure.\nBenefits of Using Skeleton Screens\nSkeleton screens help the user understand that the page is loading, while also communicating what the page will look like. Here are a few reasons why you might consider using skeleton screens:\nPrevent the user from thinking that the site isn\u2019t working.\nWhen a user visits a site or an application and they come across a blank screen while the page is loading, they may assume something is wrong and leave. Skeleton screens help users focus on the content being loaded and give them something to look at while waiting.\nCreate the illusion of a shorter wait time.\nLong loading times\nannoy users. Because a skeleton screen looks like a wireframe, it creates the illusion that the page is gradually transitioning into its final format. The indication of progress gives users a sense that it won\u2019t take a long time to load.\nReduce users\u2019\ncognitive load\n.\nInstead of overwhelming users by showing them a blank page first and then immediately a full page of content, skeleton screens help users process what the page will look like and give them time to develop mental models of the page structure before they are bombarded with a lot of information at once. For example, when users see a big square with a little box under it, they will know to expect an image with a caption.\nAre Skeleton Screens Better than Progress Bars or Spinners?\nSkeleton screens, progress bars, and spinners all show that the system is loading information, but they serve different purposes and work best in different situations. Here are a few guidelines to help you make the decision on when to use each design.\nWaiting-Period Lengths Matter\nSpinners or wait animations provide feedback to users that the system is working but don\u2019t give any indication on how long users will have to wait; therefore, they are best used when the page takes 2\u201310 seconds to load. Similarly, skeleton screens should be used with a wait time that\u2019s under 10 seconds. On the other hand, progress bars are strongly recommended for any page that takes longer that 10 seconds to load because they give users a sense of the state of the system and of how much longer they have to wait. Anything above 10 seconds requires an explicit estimation of duration.\nFor waiting periods less than 10 seconds, both skeleton screens and spinners could work\n.\nHow do you decide between the two? Spinners are typically best used on a single module, like a video or a card which is on a dashboard. Skeleton screens (with the exception of frame-display ones) are better when the full screen is loading because the wireframe gives users a sense of what the page will look like and, thus, minimizes cognitive load.\nNo Skeleton Screens or Spinners for Quick Page Loads\nIf a page takes\nless than 1 second\nto load, skeleton screens or spinners aren\u2019t necessary, as they likely won\u2019t make a difference to the users\u2019 experience.\u00a0Using a skeleton screen in such situations can be annoying because the quick flashing page can cause users to feel like they can\u2019t keep up.\nProgress Bars Are Best for Process-Related Indicators\nSkeleton screens are used to indicate progress only when the process that the system is performing is a full-page load. Whenever some other process (e.g., download, upload, convert a file) is involved, it does not make sense (and could even be confusing) to show a skeleton screen. Instead, show a progress bar or a\nwizard\nthat walks the user through the steps of the process.\nDo Not Use a Frame-Display Skeleton Screen\nFrame-display skeleton screens display no information about the page layout; they show only a header, footer, and an empty background. They should not be used as a progress indicator because they do not give users any sense that the page is gradually transitioning into its final format. If users end up having to wait for a long time, they will assume the page is not working and abandon it.\nConclusion\nUsers generally get impatient by long loading periods. Skeleton screens ease the pain of waiting for medium-length durations by showing the page structure in a gradual manner, through placeholders and subtle animations. While skeleton screens are useful, they do not replace performance-optimization efforts. Skeleton screens are simply one extra tool for improving the wait users sometimes have to experience when content is loading.\nReferences\nThomas Mejtoft, Arvid L\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m, and Ulrik S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m. 2018.
