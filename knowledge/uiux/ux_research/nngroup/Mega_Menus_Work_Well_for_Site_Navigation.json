They are an excellent design choice for accommodating a large number of options or for revealing lower-level site pages at a glance.\nAs the following screenshots show, mega menus have the following characteristics:\nBig,\ntwo-dimensional panels\ndivided into\ngroups\nof navigation options\nNavigation choices\nstructured\nthrough layout, typography, and (sometimes) icons\nEverything\nvisible at once\n\u2014 no scrolling\nVertical or horizontal\nform factors when activated from top navigation bars; when activated from left-hand navigation, they might appear as\nmega fly-outs\n(not shown)\nMenu options revealed on\nhover, click, or tap\nThe DaveRamsey.com mega menu separated the content into five distinct groups. Users opening the mega menu could quickly scan the different categories.\nThe Nova Scotia mega menu included images promoting local attractions and activities The visual styling did not differentiate well between the two distinct groups of categories,\nBrowse listings\nand\nLearn more about\n. Applying a different font face or color could have made these groups distinct.\nThe GameStop.com mega menu was hard to scan because the option labels were not frontloaded and were too similar to one another (e.g., the labels under\nXBOX 360 Pre-Owned\nare hard to differentiate because they all start with the word\nPre-Owned\n).\nRetailer JohnLewis.com used mega menus with labels that were difficult to scan and distinguish from one another.\nMoleskine.com used images in the mega menu to help users visualize and compare products.\nAs the NovaScotia and Moleskine examples show, mega menus provide sufficient space for images and other rich content. Images in the mega menu can help users select the right option.\nMega menus also allow designers to show multiple levels of the site\u2019s information architecture \u2014 in three out of the five examples above (Dave Ramsey, Game Stop, John Lewis), the mega menus contain both first-level categories and second-level categories.\nIn This Article:\nMega Menus Beat Regular Dropdowns\nTiming Considerations for Mega menus Displayed on Hover\nGrouping the Options Within a Mega Menu\nKeep Mega Menus Simple\nAccessibility\nConclusion\nMega Menus Beat Regular Dropdowns\nWe know from user testing that mega menus work. Here are some arguments to support this empirical fact:\nFor bigger sites with many features,\nregular dropdown menus\ntypically\nhide most of the user's options\n. Yes, you can scroll, but (a) it's a pain, and (b) scrolling hides the options at the top of the menu. As a result, you can't visually compare all your choices; you have to rely on\nshort-term memory\n. People have enough on their minds, and messing with short-term memory reduces their ability to accomplish tasks on your site. Mega menus show everything at a glance, so users can\nsee\u00a0rather than try to\u00a0remember\n.\nRegular dropdowns don't support\ngrouping\nunless you use kludges, such as prefixing secondary choices with a space character to indent them. Mega menus let you visually emphasize relationships among items. This again helps users understand their choices.\nWhile plain text can be wonderful,\nillustrations\ncan indeed be worth a mouthful of words, as the Moleskine example shows. Mega menus make it easy to use pictures and icons when appropriate. And, even if you stick to text alone, you have richer typography at your disposal (letting you differentiate link sizes according to their importance, for example).\nTiming Considerations for Mega menus Displayed on Hover\nIf mega menus are\ndisplayed on hover\n, one challenge is to distinguish between two different user intentions:\nThe user is just moving the mouse towards a target on the screen, and the mouse trajectory intersects the link corresponding to the mega menu.\nThe user actually looks at the navigation categories and needs more information about them.\nThe second situation should trigger the mega menu, but the first should not.\nTo account for these two user intentions, don't make response time\u00a0for a mega menu be\ntoo\nfast: the mouse should\nremain stationary for 0.5 seconds\nbefore you display anything that's hover-dependent, such as a mega menu or a tooltip. Violating this guideline will make the screen flicker insufferably when users move the mouse. Only after 0.5 seconds of resting the pointer on a navbar item can you assume that a user actually wants to see its associated dropdown.\nThus, the timing should be:\nWait 0.5 seconds.\nIf the pointer is still hovering over a navbar item, display its mega menu within 0.1 seconds.\nKeep showing it until the pointer has been outside both the navbar item and the drop-down for 0.5 seconds. Then, remove it in less than 0.1 seconds.\nOne exception to item 3: The very best implementations can sense when a user is moving the pointer from the navbar item to a destination within the dropdown. When the pointer is on such a path, the dropdown should remain visible. This supplementary guideline addresses the\ndiagonal problem\n, which happens when the path temporarily takes the pointer outside the active area. The dropdown shouldn't disappear when the user is on the way to point to something within it.\nThe diagonal problem: The pointer path goes outside the area that keeps the dropdown active.\nIn the above example, the user first pointed to the\nSport & Leisure\nnavbar item and now wants to select\nHaberdashery\n. Moving the pointer between these two spots makes it cross the\nBaby & Child\nnavbar item. Many users will move so fast that the pointer will exit the active area for less than 0.5 seconds. However, older or leisurely users might move the mouse so slowly that the dropdown would disappear while they're still aiming for a menu item. Very annoying.\nGrouping the Options Within a Mega Menu\nThe main grouping guidelines are:\nChunk options into\nrelated sets\n, such as those you discover after doing a\ncard-sorting study\nof users' mental model of the features.\nKeep a medium level of\ngranularity\n. Don't offer huge groups with numerous options that require extensive time to scan. Conversely, don't make the individual groups so small that the mega menu has an overabundance of groups that users have to spend time understanding.\nUse concise, yet\ndescriptive labels\nfor each group. Remember the standard rules for\nwriting for the web\n: enhance scannability by\nstarting with the most information-carrying word\nand\navoid made-up terms\n.\nTo keep words short and direct; the base form of verbs (\"shop\") is usually better than gerunds (\"shopping\").\nDifferentiate labels. JohnLewis.com\u2019s\nGift\nby Interest\nand\nGift\nby\nOccasion\n, for example, don't work well together.\nOrder\nthe groups. You can do this using an inherent order among the features (as for a workflow) or according to importance, putting the most important or frequently used group in the top-left corner (assuming a left-to-right language like English).\nShow each choice only once\n.\nDuplicating options\nmakes users wonder whether the two occurrences are the same or different. Also, redundancy makes the entire interface bigger and more cumbersome.\nKeep Mega Menus Simple\nThe standard usability guideline to \"keep it simple\" also applies to mega menus. Just because you\ncan\nput anything into them doesn't mean that you should. Simplicity applies to interaction semantics at least as much as it applies to the presentation layer. Fewer options mean less to scan, less to understand, and less to get wrong.\nIn particular,\navoid GUI widgets\nand other interface elements that involve more advanced interaction than a simple click. Mega menus are a fleeting screen presence and shouldn't replace dialog boxes, which are the natural home for more complex interactions and can support them better. Among other benefits, dialog boxes have a standard dismissal method (the\nOK/Cancel buttons\n), stay on the screen until they're dismissed, and can be moved around if users need to see something that the box obscures.\nSimilarly \u2014 but worse still \u2014 is hiding the search box within a mega menu. This is bad for two reasons:\nThe\nsearch box should be continuously visible\non the page rather than displayed only when users activate the mega menu.\nHaving GUI widgets (a text field and a command button) makes the mega menu a heavyweight interaction area instead of a simple navigation menu.\nAccessibility\nBecause dynamic screen elements always have the potential to cause accessibility problems, it's important to code them with screen readers and other assistive technology in mind.\nEven if coded correctly, mega menus can cause problems for low-vision users who use screen magnifiers to enlarge tiny portions of the screen. (The same issue impacts smartphone and tablet users.) With a small screen or a screen magnifier, only a small portion of the mega menu might be visible.\nWhen John Lewis\u2019s site is viewed with a site magnifier users may not realize that the mega menu contains other options that do not fit the screen.\nFor example, in the JohnLewis.com screenshot above, the screen magnifier will show the first groups but not the\nGift Food & Alcohol\ntopic or those right of this groups. The missing drop shadow, which appears on the full menu's right edge, is too subtle a signal to help most users, particularly those with poor vision. Users may assume that the visible content is all the content that is available, and, thus, the site could lose orders if it had many low-vision customers (a common situation for sites\ntargeting older users\n). Having a strong visual signal for menu borders is one way to alleviate this problem.\nIn addition, tiny options inside mega menus cause\nselection errors on touchscreens\n, and overly finicky show/hide behaviors hurt people with motor skills impairment.\nThere are two main approaches to improving the accessibility of mega menus:\nSimple\n: Don't bother making the dropdown itself accessible. Instead, make each top-level menu choice clickable,\nleading to a regular Web page\nwhere you present all dropdown options in plain, fully accessible HTML.\nAdvanced\n: Edit the site from the backend using a jQuery plugin that will make the mega menu screen reader accessible. This will also require structural changes to the HTML and CSS.\nIf you're a rich company and/or especially concerned with accessibility, you should implement both the simple and advanced features. Most sites, however, will probably have to make do with the simple approach.\nConclusion\nMega menus may improve the navigability of your site. (Of course, it's always best to test.) By helping users\nfind\nmore, they'll help you\nsell\nmore (or meet other business goals, such as\nattracting donations\nor disseminating helpful information for\nnonprofit or government sites\n).\nSee also:\narticle on the\ndownsides of poorly-designed mega menus\n.\nRelated Courses\nEmerging Patterns in Interface Design\nTrending UX patterns and their impact on the total user experience\nInteraction\nmenus,Navigation,web trends\nRelated Topics\nNavigation\nNavigation\nLearn More:\nCard View vs. List View\nMegan Chan\n\u00b7\n5 min\nDestination Pages vs. Transition Pages\nHuei-Hsin Wang\n\u00b7\n5 min\nAI for Tone: Avoid Sounding Like a Robot\nTaylor Dykes\n\u00b7\n2 min\nRelated Articles:\nExpandable Menus: Pull-Down, Square, or Pie?\nRaluca Budiu\n\u00b7\n9 min\nRight-Justified Navigation Menus Impede Scannability\nJakob Nielsen\n\u00b7\n2 min\nTop 10 Enduring Web-Design Mistakes\nAmy Schade,  Yunnuo Cheng, and  Samyukta Sherugar\n\u00b7\n9 min\nVisual Indicators to Differentiate Items in a List\nAurora Harley\n\u00b7\n6 min\nNavigation: You Are Here\nSusan Farrell\n\u00b7\n6 min\nUtility Navigation: What It Is and How to Design It\nSusan Farrell\n\u00b7\n4 min",
