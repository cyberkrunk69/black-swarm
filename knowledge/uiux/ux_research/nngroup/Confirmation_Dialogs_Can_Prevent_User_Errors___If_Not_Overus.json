They represent one of the\n5 key quality components of usability\n: error frequency and severity are negatively related to the usability of a system. And error prevention is one of the\n10 heuristics for user interface design\n.\nEven though we talk about \u201cuser error,\u201d the\ntrue culprit is the designer\n, for having made it too easy for users to get into trouble. We cannot assume that people will always use our design in the intended manner.\nThere are many ways to\nprevent (or at least reduce) user errors\n. Here, we\u2019ll focus on one of the simplest \u2014 the confirmation dialog.\nConfirmation dialog:\nAsks users whether they are sure that they want to proceed with a command that they have just issued to a system.\nIn graphical user interfaces, a confirmation dialog usually takes the form of a\nmodal dialog box\nthat pops up and must be attended to before the system will execute the user\u2019s command. (Other interaction styles may use different formats for confirmation dialogs. For example, a\nvoice UI\nmight use a spoken question that the user can reply to with a \u201cyes\u201d or a \u201cno.\u201d) Whatever the format, confirmation dialogs constitute an interruption initiated by the system; they slow down the user\u2019s task flow. If this delay prevents an error, then it\u2019s time well spent, but, if not, they are disruptive and thus annoying.\nWindows 10 offers a good example of a confirmation dialog when the user attempts to empty a recycle bin that contains a single file:\nWindows 10: The confirmation dialog to delete a single file is an example of good (though not perfect) design.\nHowever, when the recycle bin contains multiple files, Windows 10 uses a less usable confirmation dialog:\nWindows 10: The confirmation dialog to delete multiple files displays questionable design.\nFirst of all, why does Windows use two different icons to represent the same issue (permanent file deletion)? The X and the exclamation mark are both\nreasonable icons\nfor this type of warning, but pick one, for the sake of\nconsistency\n(another top-10 UI heuristic). However, this is a minor issue, since I\u2019m sure users don\u2019t base their response to these dialogs on an analysis of the icons.\nThe problem with the multiple-file confirmation plagues many confirmation dialogs:\nlack of specificity.\nSaying\nthese 2 items\ndoesn\u2019t tell users which files will be deleted. In contrast, the single-file confirmation shows the name of the file, as well as some supplementary info that\u2019ll help the user determine whether the right file will be deleted. (For even better usability, display a thumbnail of the file instead of a generic icon.) Admittedly, it\u2019s hard to provide much detail when many files are being deleted, and stating the number of files is one small amount of specificity.\nLet\u2019s go back to basics: why have confirmation dialogs in the first place? To\nallow users a second chance\nto check their work before proceeding with a dangerous action. However, it\u2019s not a second chance at all if users automate their response to the conformation and simply click\nYes\nwithout thinking further.\nA confirmation dialog must restate the user\u2019s request and explain what the computer is about to do, with specific information that allows users to understand the effects of their action. Without identifying details it\u2019s useless to ask users to confirm a request, as shown by the video-delete confirmation from YouTube:\nYouTube: The confirmation dialog to delete a video lacks specificity. It\u2019s admittedly helpful that the dialog ups the ante by saying\n\u201cYou can\u2019t undo this,\u201d\nthough it would be much better if the system provided resilience by keeping a backup copy of the deleted video around for a little time, so that the user could in fact undo a deletion.\nWhen users are asked\nAre you sure you want to do this?\nwithout further details, the only sensible reaction is \u201cof course I want to do the thing I just told you to do,\u201d and hit\nYes\nwithout further thinking. Such automated behavior provides no protection at all, and only serves to\nannoy users\n\u2014 and make them pay less attention to future warnings.\nGuidelines for Confirmation Dialog Design\nUse a confirmation dialog before committing to\nactions with serious consequences\n\u2014 such as destroying users\u2019 work or costing large amounts of money. In particular, consider a confirmation dialog before actions that cannot be undone. (Though as mentioned, do try your best to offer undo \u2014 a key component of another usability heuristic, user control and freedom \u2014 in order to reduce anxiety and allow users to recover from major problems.)\nDo not use confirmation dialogs for\nroutine actions\n. Like in Aesop\u2019s fable, if you cry wolf too many times, people will stop paying attention to the question, and the confirmation dialog will lose its power to prevent errors.\nBe\nspecific\nand inform users about the consequence of their action. Do not ask\nAre you sure you want to do this?\nInstead, explain what\nthis\nis, in\nuser-centric terms\nthat are\neasy to understand\nand make it likely that the user would recognize a mistake.\nInstead of\nYes/No\nanswers, provide\nresponse options that summarize\nwhat will happen for each possible response. For example, in the case of file deletion, use buttons labeled\nDelete file\nand\nKeep file\n.\nConsider using\nprogressive disclosure\nto allow users to\nfind out more\nabout the consequences of their command before they commit, while still keeping the text in the confirmation dialog brief enough to be easily\nscannable\n.\nMicrosoft Word: This confirmation dialog is too verbose, but the\nTell Me More\nbutton is a good example of using progressive disclosure to keep secondary content out of most people\u2019s eyes.\nAvoid giving confirmation dialogs a\ndefault\nYes\nanswer. Usually it\u2019s good to have the most common options as the\ndefault\nin a dialog box: doing so saves users time and also educates newbies as to the most likely answer. However, the entire purpose of confirmations is to make sure that users double-check their action and don\u2019t proceed unless they\u2019re really sure that they want to perform the dangerous action. You could potentially make\nNo\ninto the default, but it\u2019s probably best not to have a default answer at all.\nFor particularly dangerous operations, require a\nnonstandard action\nfrom the user to confirm. Rather than simply clicking an\nOK\nbutton (or, better, a button with a word or two to describe the action) \u2014 which risks becoming an automated behavior \u2014 have people do something they would normally not do. For example, type a word into a box, as MailChimp requires before deleting a mailing list. (Don Norman goes so far as to suggest\nrequiring a different user to confirm\nthe most dangerous actions.) Such nonstandard response options have to be reserved for the most dangerous and rare actions, because, if they\u2019re used too frequently, they become a new standard and risk turning into yet another automated behavior that loses its power to make the user think through the consequences before committing.\nMailChimp: Confirmation dialog to delete a mailing list follows several of our confirmation-dialog guidelines: (1) specificity through the name of the list and (probably more important) the number of subscribers; (2) extra protection against automated behavior by forcing the user to explicitly type in the word\nDELETE\n; moreover, the type-in field doesn\u2019t appear until after the user has scrolled. Such a heavy-handed confirmation dialog should be reserved for the most serious cases. (An even better design would provide the user with the opportunity to undo this destructive action.)\nConsider a\ncustomization option\nthat allows the user to\nbypass future routine confirmations\n. (See the\nDo not ask me again about converting documents\ncheckbox from Microsoft Word under guideline #5.) It\u2019s true that guideline #2 says not to use routine confirmations; however, for educational purposes, occasionally you may want to provide confirmations anyway when introducing new features with undesired side effects, even though these effects are not serious. Such confirmations ought to be temporary, and you should offer users a way to avoid them.\nThere is admittedly a tension between guidelines #1 and #2: you want to warn against serious consequences, but you don\u2019t want to warn so often that the warning is overlooked and the answer becomes an automated behavior. The solution is to conduct a task analysis to determine the severity of different outcomes and the frequency of possible user actions. For example, a banking site might be\npersonalized\nto only require confirmation for online payments that are at least twice the amount of each user\u2019s normal range of payments: if I usually pay bills that are around $100\u2013$500, then my first request to pay somebody $1,100 could well be an error, and the desired payment might only be $110. Even if I did want to pay $1,100, I might welcome the chance to doublecheck a payment that would be big \u2014 and thus scary \u2014 for me. On the other hand, somebody who pays $10,000 bills several times per day would be annoyed to be interrupted for a $1,100 payment. (\u201cTwice the usual amount\u201d is just an example, and not necessarily the optimal threshold \u2014 determining that requires user research.)\nMicrosoft provides an even larger set of design guidelines\nfor confirmation dialogs, including how to handle bulk confirms for a sequence of actions. Ultimately, though, I think the most important usability considerations in confirmation dialogs is to\nnot overuse\nthem and to be sufficiently\nspecific\nthat users know what they\u2019re agreeing to. I say again: if you warn people too much, they stop paying attention. If I said this a few more times, you would stop reading.\nFinally, for improved total user experience, beyond the design of the dialog box itself, do go to great lengths to provide\nundo\n, because some user errors will remain despite the even the best of confirmation dialogs. All you can do is to reduce the number of user errors, but that\u2019s an extremely worthy goal that will increase customer satisfaction, possibly save lives, and definitely increase the business value of your design.\nRelated Courses\nApplication Design for Web and Desktop\nComponents, design patterns, workflows, and ways of interacting with complex data\nInteraction\nerrors,Application Design\nRelated Topics\nApplication Design\nApplication Design\nLearn More:\nCheck Error-Message Quality with a Scoring Rubric\nEvan Sunwall\n\u00b7\n4 min\nCreate Efficient Error Messages\nEvan Sunwall\n\u00b7\n4 min\nError Messages 101\nTim Neusesser\n\u00b7\n3 min\nRelated Articles:\nWhat the Erroneous Hawaiian Missile Alert Can Teach Us About Error Prevention\nKim Flaherty\n\u00b7\n6 min\nPreventing User Errors: Avoiding Conscious Mistakes\nPage Laubheimer\n\u00b7\n9 min\nPreventing User Errors: Avoiding Unconscious Slips\nPage Laubheimer\n\u00b7\n6 min\nInput Controls for Parameters: Balancing Exploration and Precision with Sliders, Knobs, and Matrices\nPage Laubheimer\n\u00b7\n9 min\nOnboarding Tutorials vs. Contextual Help\nPage Laubheimer\n\u00b7\n7 min\nFitts's Law and Its Applications in UX\nRaluca Budiu\n\u00b7\n10 min",

Use a confirmation dialog before committing to **actions with serious consequences** \u2014 such as destroying users\u2019 work or costing large amounts of money. In particular, consider a confirmation dialog before actions that cannot be undone. (Though as mentioned, do try your best to offer undo \u2014 a key component of another usability heuristic, user control and freedom \u2014 in order to reduce anxiety and allow users to recover from major problems.)\n2. Do not use confirmation dialogs for **routine actions**. Like in Aesop\u2019s fable, if you cry wolf too many times, people will stop paying attention to the question, and the confirmation dialog will lose its power to prevent errors.\n3. Be **specific** and inform users about the consequence of their action. Do not ask *Are you sure you want to do this?* Instead, explain what *this* is, in [user-centric terms](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-centric-language/) that are [easy to understand](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/legibility-readability-comprehension/) and make it likely that the user would recognize a mistake.\n4. Instead of *Yes/No* answers, provide **response options that summarize** what will happen for each possible response. For example, in the case of file deletion, use buttons labeled *Delete file* and *Keep file*.\n5. Consider using [progressive disclosure](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/) to allow users to **find out more** about the consequences of their command before they commit, while still keeping the text in the confirmation dialog brief enough to be easily [scannable](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/).\n   ![Microsoft Word confirmation dialog with progressive disclosure](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2018/01/23/msword-confirmation-progressive-disclosure.png)\n\n   *Microsoft Word: This confirmation dialog is too verbose, but the* Tell Me More *button is a good example of using progressive disclosure to keep secondary content out of most people\u2019s eyes.*\n6. Avoid giving confirmation dialogs a **default** *Yes* answer. Usually it\u2019s good to have the most common options as the [default](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-power-of-defaults/) in a dialog box: doing so saves users time and also educates newbies as to the most likely answer. However, the entire purpose of confirmations is to make sure that users double-check their action and don\u2019t proceed unless they\u2019re really sure that they want to perform the dangerous action.
