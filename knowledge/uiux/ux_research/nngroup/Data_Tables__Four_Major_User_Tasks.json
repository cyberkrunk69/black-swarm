Tables are present in many\nworkplace applications\nprecisely because they are a compact way of showing a large multivariate dataset. However, big tables present challenges to both designers and users.\nThis article is part of a series that covers various aspects of designing usable tables:\nCommon user tasks associated with tables and how to support them on desktop\nHow to deal with\ntables that are too big for the screens\non which they are displayed \u2014 including tables for mobile or variable-size\u00a0viewports (as in\nresponsive design\n)\nNote:\u00a0this article is primarily concerned with large data tables used in the workplace rather than with\nproduct-comparison tables\n(common on ecommerce websites).\nIn This Article:\nTables vs. Cards or Modules for Data Presentation\nMain User Tasks in Tables\nTaking Action on Records\nSummary\nTables vs. Cards or Modules for Data Presentation\nTables are not usually winners of a UI beauty contest \u2014 they are a utilitarian part of our designs. To embrace their functional advantages over other, perhaps more aesthetically pleasing, forms of multivariate-data displays (such as collections of\ncards\nor\ndashboards\nwith various\ninformation visualizations\nand\ndata charts\n), we need to understand when to use tables and what kinds of user tasks are suited to them.\nThe primary advantages of a data table over other data-presentation options are:\nScalability\n: It\u2019s easy to increase both the number of rows and the number of columns in a table if your dataset changes.\nSupport for\ncomparison\ntasks: In a table, two adjacent data points are easy to compare because, unlike with a card-based UI, users don\u2019t need to either move their eyes much or store information in their\nworking memory\n, as they can see both items at the same time.\nA card-based presentation of multivariate data requires users to spatially reorient each time they move their eyes from one card to another, making comparison tasks cognitively effortful and slow.\nMain User Tasks in Tables\nWhile the specific tasks carried out on a table will vary depending on applications or even users, the following 4 tasks are frequently performed and can be considered the core tasks to be supported by a table design:\nFind record(s) that fit specific criteria\nCompare data\nView, edit or add a single row\u2019s data\nTake action(s) on records\nFind Record(s) that Fit Specific Criteria\nWhen users engage in this type of task, they may seek a specific item (whose name or other pertinent details they already know) or may look for several items that meet a few criteria they have in mind.\nThis process might involve filtering, sorting, using a search feature (or using the browser\u2019s built-in\nCTRL-F\nfeature on the page), or simply\nvisually scanning\ndown the table. The reasons users will choose one of those interactions can be hard to predict and it\u2019s based on the specifics of the data table, as well as on their expectations of what will be the least effortful way to find what they\u2019re looking for.\nAn eyetracking gazeplot shows a participant fixating back and forth between the table\u2019s data and the filters above. At one point, the participant engages in a hierarchical search of the table, moving his eyes between the first column, second column, then skipping to the fourth and sixth columns before moving to the next row of data and repeating the procedure.\nDesigning to support this task involves a few different things:\nThe (default\n) first column should be a human-readable record identifier\ninstead of a \u201cmystery meat\u201d automatically generated ID. This design will allow users to scan and locate a record of interest.\nThe\ndefault order of the columns should reflect the importance of the data\nto the user and related columns should be adjacent. In other words, once a user has located a potential record of interest, don\u2019t force them to move their eyes back and forth between column 1 and column 20 because those are the most relevant columns.\nFilters\nneed to be discoverable, quick, and powerful. Filter syntax should be transparent to users. Moreover, users should be able to easily understand that they are looking at filtered data (that is, there should be a clear visual indication that filters are active).\nCompare Data\nTables are most effective when they allow users to easily compare data \u2014 whether this data is in two or more records or in different columns. Often, these comparisons aim to detect relationships between different variables or records, data ranges for a column, outliers or to simply explore what is typical for one or more variables.\nThere are two common issues that users encounter when performing comparisons in complex, big tables:\nBecause of the sheer volume of data filling up the screen, it can be complicated to understand\nwhat each cell stands for and to which record it belongs\n.\nSometimes the\ncolumns users wish to compare are far away\nfrom each other \u2014 with one being even perhaps off canvas and requiring horizontal scrolling to view. Not only is scrolling back and forth tedious, but users will also need to memorize data from one column, bring the other column into view, and compare what they remember with what they see.\nThe same thing can happen with\nrows\n\u2014 if people need to compare data from nonadjacent rows, it can be difficult to move back and forth between them and also ensure that the user is looking at the right cell.\nThe primary design solutions ensure that:\nUsers will always know what they\u2019re looking at.\nData points of interest can be brought in close proximity.\nHere are some specific guidelines related to these two principles.\n1. Locating Relevant Info\nFreeze\nheader\nrows and header columns (if the table is larger than the screen).\nThe visual design needs to enable users to keep their place as they move their eyes across the table.\nBorders\n,\nzebra striping\n, and\nhover-triggered highlighting\nof a record can all help.\n2. Making Information Adjacent for Comparison\nHiding and reordering columns\nmust be easy to accomplish (low\ninteraction cost\nand accessible for those that don\u2019t use\ndrag and drop\ninteractions). These features should be\ndiscoverable\nand clear visual\nstate indicators\nshould signal to users that some columns are hidden.\nHiding or reordering records\nand\nsorting\nafter a particular variable should also be easy to accomplish. (This feature is often related to filtering, but is not exactly the same \u2014 the user should be able to manually hide one or more records.)\nA frozen header row and first column, light borders, and zebra striping all support visual scanning behaviors and help users to keep their place as they look around and compare data. The subtle use of a drop shadow suggests that that the frozen first column and header row are floating \u201cabove\u201d the rest of the table\u2019s data, assisting with spatial orientation.\nAn easily noticeable menu for hiding columns, that clearly indicates the current state (15 columns are currently hidden). Reordering columns here can be done in two ways: (1) dragging and dropping the column headers themselves (which has relatively low discoverability and poor accessibility, but is an efficient\naccelerator\nonce learned) or (2) dragging and dropping from the list of columns in this visible menu.\nView, Edit, or Add a Single Row\nAnother common task in tables involves viewing, creating, or editing a single record. For all three cases, a tabular presentation of a single record can be challenging to read (and even more so to edit), especially when the table is wide and the user will have to scroll horizontally in order to access all the fields.\nThere are a variety of ways to present a single record as a complete unit, optimized for readability and editability.\u00a0Each has different tradeoffs to consider:\nA modal popup for editing obscures information on the table.\nEdit in place\n(where the table row becomes editable). This solution works only if the table is narrow. Make sure that the row looks different in\nEdit\nmode,\nso that the user can clearly see what is editable to prevent accidental edits.\nModal popup\n. The big downside with a\nmodal implementation\n(and why we generally don\u2019t recommend modals for deep editing work) is that it will cover adjacent records in the table and the user won\u2019t be able to reference or copy data from a similar record. We routinely observe in testing that users refer to existing data in other records while they edit a record (as that helps them to\nrecognize, rather than recall\nreasonable value ranges).\nNonmodal panel or separate window\n. Either of these options will cover some of the table, but still allow users access to the table data.\nOpening the row as an\naccordion\n.\u00a0While this presentation doesn\u2019t obscure other parts of the table, a downside is that users don\u2019t tend to clean up after themselves (i.e., close accordions when they are done with them) and they may end up with cluttered displays unsuited for the other core table tasks. More important, users will have difficulty referring to records that are not in immediate proximity of the one being edited.\nA nonmodal side panel allows for the full display (and editing) of a single record while still allowing the user to view the rest of the table\u2019s data.\nTaking Action on Records\nAnother important task in a table is to take action on one or multiple records (beyond editing the record itself) \u2014 for example, deleting, sharing, or performing some other data-specific action (like sending out invoices, changing deadlines, etc.).\nTraditionally, there are two ways to implement this task:\nsingle-record actions\nand\nbatch actions\n.\nSingle-Record Actions\nPlacing the\nsingle-record actions\ninline within a table row can work if you just have one or two actions, but, when there are more, screen space becomes an issue. As a result, multiple single-record actions end up either:\nCrowded\n, with no text labels, and thus be\nhard to click\nand also hard to distinguish, or\nHidden\nunder a hover gesture or a generic\nActions\nmenu, and thus hard to discover (and potentially with low accessibility if a hover gesture is used).\nBatch Actions\nBatch actions\nusually involve a mechanism for selecting records (e.g., a\ncheckbox\nfor each record) and then a series of action buttons or menus above or below the table. This type of design allows for a space-efficient presentation of multiple options. If applying the same action to the full data set is a common need, it\u2019s a convenient shortcut to have a single-click option to\nSelect All\n.\nSummary\nCompared to modular presentations such as card-based displays, tables are space efficient and well suited for comparing records and for detecting patterns in the data.\nData tables must support the following frequent user tasks:\nFind record(s) that fit specific criteria\nCompare data\nView, edit or add a single row\nTaking action on records\nRelated Courses\nApplication Design for Web and Desktop\nComponents, design patterns, workflows, and ways of interacting with complex data\nInteraction\nApplication Design,tables,complex applications,digital workplace,Human Computer Interaction\nRelated Topics\nApplication Design\nApplication Design\nHuman Computer Interaction\nLearn More:\nIcon Interpretation vs. Recognizability\nKate Kaplan\n\u00b7\n4 min\nIs the Floppy Disk Dead?\nKate Kaplan\n\u00b7\n4 min\n2-Factor Authentication (2-FA)\nTim Neusesser\n\u00b7\n4 min\nRelated Articles:\nDesigning for Long Waits and Interruptions: Mitigating Breaks in Workflow in Complex Application Design\nKate Kaplan\n\u00b7\n9 min\n8 Design Guidelines for Complex Applications\nKate Kaplan\n\u00b7\n8 min\nState-Switch Controls: The Infamous Case of the \"Mute\" Button\nRaluca Budiu\n\u00b7\n6 min\nComplex Application Design: A 5-Layer Framework\nKate Kaplan\n\u00b7\n12 min\nMobile-App Onboarding: An Analysis of Components and Techniques\nAlita Kendrick\n\u00b7\n10 min\nListboxes vs. Dropdown Lists\nAnna Kaley\n\u00b7\n10 min",
