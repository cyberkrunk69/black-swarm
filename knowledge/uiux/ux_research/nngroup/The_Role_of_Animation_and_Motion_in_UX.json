Use it for feedback, state-change and navigation metaphors, and to enhance signifiers.\nIn UX, motion and animation can be helpful and communicative, if used with restraint. Motion is most often appropriate as a form of\nsubtle\nfeedback\nfor\nmicrointeractions\n, rather than to induce delight or entertain users. In this article, we explore the purposes of useful, unobtrusive feedback animation. In a second (forthcoming) article, we will discuss the details in timing and movement to make these animations appear smooth and natural.\nThe big advantage (and also drawback) of UI motion is that it\nattracts user attention\n. Our peripheral vision (specifically, through the rod-shaped photoreceptors in the human retina) is responsible for detecting motion.\u00a0 Evolutionarily, the fact that we can detect a movement outside the center of our field of vision is, of course, an advantage: we can discern danger and protect ourselves. But that means that we are sensitive and prone to be\ndistracted\nby any type of motion (meaningful or not). That\u2019s why motion in user interfaces can easily become annoying: it\u2019s hard to stop attending to it, and, if irrelevant to the task at hand, it can substantially degrade the user experience (as any web user who has encountered a moving\nadvertisement\ncan attest).\nAlthough animations\ncan\nbe useful and can build\nuser expectation\ns about the UI, they should be used with a light touch \u2014 primarily as a tool for providing users with easily noticeable, smooth feedback.\nIn This Article:\nPurpose of UI Animations\nMotion to Communicate State Change\nAttention Grabbing and Attention Hijacking\nReferences\nPurpose of UI Animations\nWhen animation is used in a subtle way, it can help users build mental models about how the system works and how they can interact with it.\u00a0 Animations are less critical for user experience when they are simply time-filling visual stimulations during moments of transition (in fact, it\u2019s these down-time animations that often frustrate participants in usability testing).\u00a0 Instead of using animations to provide\nsurface-level delight\n(that quickly sours), animations can be leveraged for usability: as clues about what is currently happening with the system, as signifiers for how UI elements will behave, and as easily understandable spatial metaphors for the user\u2019s location in the information space.\nMotion for Feedback\nAnimations are often helpful as a form of noticeable feedback that an action has been recognized by the system. \u00a0A ubiquitous example is the animation of a navigation menu sliding over the page when a\nhamburger\nicon is tapped. \u00a0Because our visual systems are so attuned to motion, a short animation can ensure that users see the feedback.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nAmerican Museum of Natural History: When clicking the\nExhibitions\nmenu icon in the middle of the page, a menu panel slides over from the left side on top of the page\u2019s content, rather than appearing suddenly like a new page.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nEpicurious for iPhone: A shopping-list feature shows a subtle animated feedback when the user adds a new item to the list: upon hitting the\nDone\nbutton on the keyboard, the word that was just typed (\nCoffee,\nin this case) instantly becomes light gray, and then quickly changes to black to show that it has been accepted. At the same time, the input field both fades in and slides down below, signaling that it is waiting for new input.\nSometimes, static visual feedback is ignored due to c\nhange blindness\n. For example, people may not notice the shopping-cart\u2013badge update after clicking the\nAdd to cart\nbutton in the Cuisinart example below. An animation increases the chance of noticing that feedback. (Another alternative would be to make the static feedback more prominent \u2014 e.g., through a dialog box or using a bigger badge. Both solutions would likely be more intrusive than a simple animation.)\nCuisinart.com: After the user clicks\nAdd to\u00a0cart,\nthe cart badge simply updates, with no animation. Because the badge is small and\u00a0far away\u00a0from the\nAdd to cart\nbutton (which is likely where the user is looking), it\u2019s easy to miss this change. The result could be that the user adds the same product to the cart multiple times.\nAnd animations can also be used as a form of feedback\nbefore\nthe user commits to an action, such as previewing the new location of an item when using drag-and-drop to reorder a list.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nAirtable: When drag-and-drop is used to reorder columns in a table, a subtle animation gives a preview of the new order before the user lets go and commits to the action.\nMotion to Communicate State Change\nMotion can be used to indicate that the interface switched to a different state \u2014 for example, because of a mode change.\nModes\nare often a difficult concept to communicate to users, but animation can help in two ways: (1) by making the mode change noticeable; and (2) by providing a conceptual metaphor of the mode transition. For example, morphing a pencil icon into a disk after it was clicked on signals the transition from\nEdit\nto\nSave\nmode more clearly than swapping one icon out for the other instantly.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nMaterial Design: A pencil icon that transforms into a + icon helps to communicate the difference between the\nEdit\nmode and the\nAdd new\nmode.\nIn addition to showing a transition between modes or views of data, animations are also helpful for communicating state changes that are not triggered by users\u2019 actions. For example, loading indicators show that the system is not yet ready to accept input. \u00a0One form of this is a \u201cskeleton screen\u201d (a placeholder UI that looks like a wireframe of the loading page, with no content) that is animated by a light glare moving across it.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nHipmunk: While loading flight-search results, Hipmunk offers several animated cues. First, there is an animated chipmunk pretending to fly. (While cute, the chipmunk is not essential for feedback, but is helpful to establish the\nbrand tone.\n) However, at the same time, other, more-communicative animations occur: the number of flight results climbs steadily from 0 to 754, indicating that the system is performing multiple federated searches concurrently. Also, a placeholder shows where content will appear as flight results load. \u00a0A\nprogress bar\n, along with two animated ellipses, indicates that results are still loading.\u00a0 Finally, as new results are loaded and the relevance order changes, a subtle animation shows new results appearing within the list and is meant to communicate that the order of the search results is changing dynamically.\u00a0 However, the number of simultaneous animations is overwhelming: the power of any of these animations to pull the user\u2019s attention is diminished by competition from all the others.\nMotion for Spatial Metaphors and Navigation\nThe structure of a complex information space is often challenging to communicate to users without taxing their cognitive resources or taking up too much screen space. Scanning through navigation menus, tree diagrams, or even\nbreadcrumbs\nto figure out where one is in the information hierarchy is a complex type of cognitive work. While animation alone is not a suitable substitute for visible navigation with clear, unbranded labels, it can signal to users the direction in which they are moving within a process or hierarchy; this\nsupplemental\ncue\ncan make navigation through a complex IA more intuitive and understandable.\nZooming animations can help users understand the direction of their journey into a hierarchical information space without looking at a tree diagram. Zooming out shows less detail, but more objects, thus suggesting that the user travels up into the hierarchy, whereas zooming in shows more detail, but fewer objects, creating the impression of going deeper into the hierarchy.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\niOS Photos uses a zoom metaphor to show the user\u2019s location in the information space (in this case, represented by my endless library of photos of my dog, Daphne). Going between\nYears,\u00a0Months\n, and\nDays\nhas a subtle zoom-in or zoom-out animation that helps users understand whether they are going up or down in the hierarchy of photos. This approach helps keep the user\u2019s attention on content (cute dog photos), and not on the navigation\nchrome\n.\nLikewise, a slide-over animation helps to establish that a user is moving forward or backward within a process such as checkout.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nAmtrak shows a subtle slide-over animation to indicate that the user is moving forward through the process of booking a train.\nAnimations can also prevent disorientation and telling people if they are on the same page or have moved on \u2014 particularly on mobile, where context can be lost due to the small screen size.\nAccordions\n,\nanchor links\n, and menu overlays can be disorienting or confusing if the change appears instantaneously; since a menu overlay fills the entire screen, the relationship between the overlay and the underlying page (e.g., \u201cis this content a new page, or is it something else?\u201d) is hard to understand without an animated cue. (Why does it matter if users know where they are? If they think they are on a new page, they are often tempted to use the\nBack\nbutton to navigate to the previous view; unfortunately, in the case of overlays or accordions, that action will take them away from the page instead of simply closing the element.)\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nWebMD: When opening an accordion on the page, the associated content immediately shows up at the top of the screen (with no animation). The user may think that the new content is on a brand new page. A scrolling animation (showing how the page is moved so that the accordion is at the top of the screen), followed by a moving expansion could help the user to understand that this is not a completely new page, but an accordion within the page\u2019s content.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nMetMuseum:\nAnchor links\nare often confusing or disorienting for users, but in this case, the anchor links use a smooth scrolling animation to show (1) that the content is all contained on a single page and \u00a0(2) where it is on that page.\nMotion as a Signifier\nAnimations help users understand how to interact with UI elements. The direction (or other attributes) of the motion signifies the type of acceptable actions. For example, a\ncard\nthat expands from the bottom of the screen towards the top signals to the user that it can be closed by pulling down. A new card that comes from the right of the screen signals that it can be closed by swiping it to the right.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nApple Music for iPhone: the\nNow Playing\ncard animates up into place in a manner that helps the user understand that this view can be dismissed by pulling down, rather than swiping left or right on the edge.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nCar2Go for iPhone: A short bounce animation is a signifier that\nswiping\nacross the list item reveals options.\nAttention Grabbing and Attention Hijacking\nBecause the human visual system is very sensitive to motion (particularly, to motion that appears to have\nanimacy\n), animation can be used to grab users\u2019 attention, for better or worse. On the one hand, it can make a subtle signifier obvious, but on the other hand, gratuitous animations distract and annoy the user. Further, using animation to hijack the users\u2019 attention or create a\nfear of loss\nis a\ndark pattern\n: an unethical application of user-experience principles and cognitive psychology to get users to do something they ordinarily wouldn\u2019t.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nBenign: Refinery29 embeds a poll in the middle of a story about social media\u2019s mental health effects and shows a radiating halo on the slider\u2019s knob to reinforce the signifier and catch the user\u2019s attention. This limited use of animation is a relatively benign (though mostly unhelpful) way of catching the user\u2019s attention. Were animations widespread throughout the site, this animation would be a distracting usability problem.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nDistracting: The moving squiggle on Outline\u2019s content pages adds no benefit, but needlessly draws the attention of the user away from the content.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\nDark pattern: A flashing countdown clock on warmlydecor.com indicates that a sale is about to end (by a puzzling coincidence, in just under an hour for every single product on the site, no matter when you visit). The clock activates the powerful loss-aversion instinct in users, and the flashing (with a subtle enlarging of the digits as they flash) is very difficult to avoid attending to.\nIn summary, when UI animations are subtle, unobtrusive, and brief, they can improve the user experience and can communicate feedback and state changes, prevent disorientation, and strengthen signifiers. But they should not be overused, as they can easily become overwhelming and distract users.\nReferences\nHead, V. (2016)\nDesigning Interface Animation\n. Rosenfeld Media.\nSaffer, D.

Use it for feedback, state-change and navigation metaphors, and to enhance signifiers.\n\nIn UX, motion and animation can be helpful and communicative, if used with restraint. Motion is most often appropriate as a form of *subtle* [feedback](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/indicators-validations-notifications/) for [microinteractions](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/microinteractions/), rather than to induce delight or entertain users. In this article, we explore the purposes of useful, unobtrusive feedback animation. In a second (forthcoming) article, we will discuss the details in timing and movement to make these animations appear smooth and natural.\n\nThe big advantage (and also drawback) of UI motion is that it [attracts user attention](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/animation-usability/). Our peripheral vision (specifically, through the rod-shaped photoreceptors in the human retina) is responsible for detecting motion.\u00a0 Evolutionarily, the fact that we can detect a movement outside the center of our field of vision is, of course, an advantage: we can discern danger and protect ourselves. But that means that we are sensitive and prone to be [distracted](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/distracting-animations/) by any type of motion (meaningful or not). That\u2019s why motion in user interfaces can easily become annoying: it\u2019s hard to stop attending to it, and, if irrelevant to the task at hand, it can substantially degrade the user experience (as any web user who has encountered a moving [advertisement](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/most-hated-advertising-techniques/) can attest).\n\nAlthough animations *can* be useful and can build [user expectation](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/mental-models/)s about the UI, they should be used with a light touch \u2014 primarily as a tool for providing users with easily noticeable, smooth feedback.\n\n## In This Article:\n\n- [Purpose of UI Animations](#toc-purpose-of-ui-animations-1)\n- [Motion to Communicate State Change](#toc-motion-to-communicate-state-change-2)\n- [Attention Grabbing and Attention Hijacking](#toc-attention-grabbing-and-attention-hijacking-3)\n- [References](#toc-references-4)\n\n## Purpose of UI Animations\n\nWhen animation is used in a subtle way, it can help users build mental models about how the system works and how they can interact with it.\u00a0 Animations are less critical for user experience when they are simply time-filling visual stimulations during moments of transition (in fact, it\u2019s these down-time animations that often frustrate participants in usability testing).\u00a0 Instead of using animations to provide [surface-level delight](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/theory-user-delight/) (that quickly sours), animations can be leveraged for usability: as clues about what is currently happening with the system, as signifiers for how UI elements will behave, and as easily understandable spatial metaphors for the user\u2019s location in the information space.\n\n### Motion for Feedback\n\nAnimations are often helpful as a form of noticeable feedback that an action has been recognized by the system. \u00a0A ubiquitous example is the animation of a navigation menu sliding over the page when a [hamburger](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/) icon is tapped. \u00a0Because our visual systems are so attuned to motion, a short animation can ensure that users see the feedback.\n\n[Your browser does not support the video tag.](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2020/01/06/museumnathistory-accordion-trimmed.mp4)\n\n*American Museum of Natural History: When clicking the*Exhibitions*menu icon in the middle of the page, a menu panel slides over from the left side on top of the page\u2019s content, rather than appearing suddenly like a new page.*\n\n[Your browser does not support the video tag.](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2020/01/06/epicurious-shopping-list.mov)\n\n*Epicurious for iPhone: A shopping-list feature shows a subtle animated feedback when the user adds a new item to the list: upon hitting the* Done *button on the keyboard, the word that was just typed (*Coffee, *in this case) instantly becomes light gray, and then quickly changes to black to show that it has been accepted.

The clock activates the powerful loss-aversion instinct in users, and the flashing (with a subtle enlarging of the digits as they flash) is very difficult to avoid attending to.*\n\nIn summary, when UI animations are subtle, unobtrusive, and brief, they can improve the user experience and can communicate feedback and state changes, prevent disorientation, and strengthen signifiers. But they should not be overused, as they can easily become overwhelming and distract users.\n\n## References\n\nHead, V.
