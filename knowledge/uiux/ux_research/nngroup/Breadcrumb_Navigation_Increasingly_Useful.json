User testing shows many benefits and no downsides to breadcrumbs for secondary navigation.\nNot all design decisions are a matter of website survival. Of course, it's important to\nget the big things right\n, or you won't have any users. But\ngetting the small things right\nenhances usability and fosters user comfort. A perfect example here is the breadcrumb trail.\nBreadcrumbs won't help a site answer users' questions or fix a hopelessly confused information architecture. All that breadcrumbs do is make it easier for users to move around the site, assuming its content and overall structure make sense. That's sufficient contribution for something that takes up only one line in the design.\nBreadcrumbs have always been a\nsecondary navigation\naid. They share this humble status with\nsite maps\n. To navigate, site visitors mainly use the primary menus and the search box, which are certainly more important for usability. But from time to time, people do turn to the site map or the breadcrumbs, particularly when the main navigation doesn't quite meet their needs.\nDespite their secondary status, I've\nrecommended breadcrumbs since 1995\nfor a few simple reasons:\nBreadcrumbs show people their\ncurrent location\nrelative to higher-level concepts, helping them understand where they are in relation to the rest of the site.\nBreadcrumbs afford\none-click access to higher site levels\nand thus rescue users who parachute into very specific but inappropriate destinations through search or deep links.\nBreadcrumbs\nnever cause problems in user testing\n: people might overlook this small design element, but they never misinterpret breadcrumb trails or have trouble operating them.\nBreadcrumbs\ntake up very little space\non the page.\nSo, despite the merely mid-sized benefits, the overall\ncost-benefit analysis\ncomes out quite strongly in favor of breadcrumbs. Their downside is incredibly small: while they do take up space, that space is minute. When you divide a mid-sized numerator by a tiny denominator, the resulting fraction is substantial.\nThe main argument against breadcrumbs is that many users overlook them. So, why do something that only benefits a minority?\nAs I've long argued, breadcrumbs are different than most other little-used design elements for the simple reason that they don't hurt users who ignore them.\nIn This Article:\nGrowing Popularity\nConsistency Breeds Familiarity\nHierarchy or History?\nGrowing Popularity\nThe case against breadcrumbs is crumbling. Every year we see\nmore people use breadcrumbs\nin our studies. Because breadcrumbs are not important enough for a dedicated study, I don't have an exact number for the current percentage of breadcrumb users. But it's definitely growing over time.\nIn testing an e-commerce site last month, for example, one user complained:\n\"This is missing a feature to go back to the previous page.\"\nI found this apparent request for a Back button puzzling, since the button was featured prominently in the browser and the person had easily used it earlier in the test session. Also, for six years, it's been an established guideline to avoid duplicating browser functionality in the page design.\nIt quickly became clear, however, that the user wasn't asking for a duplicate Back button. Elaborating on the previous complaint, she pointed to the place on the page where breadcrumbs typically appear and said she wanted the list of links to higher-level pages.\nIn other words, the user wanted breadcrumbs. She'd seen them before, but didn't know what they were called, so she asked for them using words that \u2014 if taken literally \u2014 would have been easily misinterpreted.\nThis is a great example of the hard-won lesson of usability:\ndon't comply with user requests\n. Give more attention to what study participants\ndo\nthan to what they\nsay\n.\nConsistency Breeds Familiarity\nHuman behavior doesn't change much over the years. My\nrecent book\ndocuments a few cases where Web design guidelines from the mid-1990s have changed. But mainly,\nusability guidelines stay the same\ndecade after decade.\nWhy are people now using breadcrumbs to the extent that they actually miss them when sites don't offer them?\nIt's exactly because of breadcrumbs' modest nature that people are becoming accustomed to them. There aren't too many ways to mess up breadcrumbs in a design. No fancy stuff, just a line of textual links.\nBreadcrumbs are\nalmost always implemented the same way\n, with a horizontal line that\nprogresses from the highest level to the lowest, one step at a time;\nstarts with the homepage and ends with the current page;\nhas a simple text link for each level (except for the current page, because you should\nnever have a link that does nothing\n); and\nhas a simple, one-character separator between the levels (usually \">\").\nThis consistency means that people know a breadcrumb trail when they see one, and immediately know how to use it. Consistency breeds familiarity and predictability, which breed usability. This again means that\nyou must comply with conventions\nin the design of your own breadcrumbs.\nBreadcrumbs are also useful for intranets: 80% of this year's\naward-winning intranets\nuse breadcrumbs. [See separate article on\nintranet information architecture (IA)\n.]\nHierarchy or History?\nI'm sometimes asked whether website breadcrumbs should follow the fairytale model of Hansel and Gretel. In that story, the children walk through a bewildering forest, dropping breadcrumbs behind them in hopes that they might later find their way out.\nIn user interface design, it's often dangerous to take metaphors too far, and breadcrumbs are again the perfect example. Offering users a Hansel-and-Gretel-style history trail is basically useless, because it simply duplicates functionality offered by the Back button, which is the Web's second-most-used feature.\nA history trail can also be confusing: users often wander in circles or go to the wrong site sections. Having each point in a confused progression at the top of the current page doesn't offer much help.\nFinally, a history trail is useless for users who arrive directly at a page deep within the site. This scenario is when breadcrumbs show their greatest usability benefit, but only if you implement them correctly \u2014 as a way to visualize the current page's location in the site's information architecture.\nBreadcrumbs should\nshow the site hierarchy\n, not the user's history. (I.e., use location-based breadcrumbs, not path-based ones.)\nFor non-hierarchical sites, breadcrumbs are useful only if you can find a way to show the current page's relation to more abstract or general concepts. For example, if you allow users to\nwinnow a large product database by specifying attributes\n(of relevance to users, of course), the breadcrumb trail can list the attributes that have been selected so far. A toy site might have breadcrumbs like these:\nHome\n>\nGirls\n>\n5-6 years\n> Outdoor play (note that the\nlinks should be colored\nas well as underlined, but I don't do this here to avoid confusion with these dummy links).\nLooking ahead, people will use breadcrumbs even more because they're an important navigation tool in Windows Vista. Most users don't distinguish clearly between the operating system, applications, and content or websites. Users will thus transfer their understanding of Vista's interaction techniques to your website.\nIf you don't have breadcrumbs, it's time to start planning for them. They'll improve your usability a bit now, meet increasing user expectations in the future, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 they won't hurt.\nSee also:\nupdate with\n11 Design Guidelines for Breadcrumbs on Desktop and Mobile\n.\nNavigation\nRelated Topics\nNavigation\nNavigation\nLearn More:\nVertical Navigation\nPage Laubheimer\n\u00b7\n2 min\nNavigation Menus - 5 Tips to Make Them Visible\nKathryn Whitenton\n\u00b7\n3 min\nFooters Are Underrated\nTherese Fessenden\n\u00b7\n4 min\nRelated Articles:\nUsing the Title Attribute to Help Users Predict Where They Are Going\nJakob Nielsen\n\u00b7\n3 min\nCentered Logos Hurt Website Navigation\nKathryn Whitenton\n\u00b7\n7 min\nThe Same Link Twice on the Same Page: Do Duplicates Help or Hurt?\nHoa Loranger\n\u00b7\n7 min\nSearch Is Not Enough: Synergy Between Navigation and Search\nRaluca Budiu\n\u00b7\n6 min\nFilters vs. Facets: Definitions\nKathryn Whitenton\n\u00b7\n3 min\nKilling Off the Global Navigation: One Trend to Avoid\nJen Cardello and  Kathryn Whitenton\n\u00b7\n8 min",
