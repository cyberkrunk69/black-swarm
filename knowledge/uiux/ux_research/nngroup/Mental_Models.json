Mismatched mental models are common, especially with designs that try something new.\nThis is an updated version of an article written by Jakob Nielsen in 2010.\nMental models are one of the most important concepts in human-computer interaction (HCI).\u00a0 This article reports a few examples of mental models in user-interface design. Not coincidentally, using concrete examples often helps people understand abstract concepts, such as mental models.\nIn This Article:\nWhat Are Mental Models?\nMental Models in Web UX\nMental-Model Inertia\nActing on Mental Models\nConclusion\nWhat Are Mental Models?\nA\nmental model\nis what the user believes about the system (web, application, or other kind of product) at hand. Mental models help the user predict how a system will work and, therefore, influence how they interact with an interface.\nThis diagram illustrates the ongoing development of users\u2019 mental models, highlighting how users\u2019 experiences shape future expectations, predictions, and decisions.\nA Mental Model Is Based on Belief, Not Facts\nA mental model is a model of what users know (or think they know) about a system such as your website.\nUsers form their predictions about the system based on their mental models and plan their future actions accordingly. A prime goal for designers is to ensure that the user interface clearly communicates the nature of the system so that users form accurate (and thus useful) mental models.\nHow do users create mental models? Often, they just use the knowledge they have about the world to create them. Remember\nJakob's law of the internet user experience\n: Users spend most of their time on websites other than yours. Thus, a big part of customers' mental models of your site will be influenced by information gleaned from other sites. People\nexpect websites to act alike\n.\nEach User Has Their Own Mental Model\nA mental model is based on each user\u2019s individual background knowledge and past experiences, so different users might construct different mental models of the same system. One of the biggest dilemmas in usability is the gap between designers' and users' mental models. Designers form wonderfully detailed mental models of their own creations, leading them to believe that each feature is easy to understand. On the other hand, most users\u2019 mental models of the system are usually less developed; as a result, they are more likely to make mistakes and find the design harder to use.\nMental\nmodels can change over time\n\u2014 due to additional experience with your system or with other systems.\nMental Models in Web UX\nAs users navigate the web, they construct mental models based on the patterns they encounter. This section discusses a few mental models common in web design. These mental models serve as the foundation for design\nstandards\n, enabling designers to create interfaces that align with users\u2019 expectations.\nOnline Shopping Carts\nWhen shopping online, users browse through products, add items to their shopping carts, and then check out. This experience is like shopping in a brick-and-mortar store, and people\u2019s expectations are influenced by their experience with physical shopping.\nOnline shopping experiences that depart from the physical shopping model create confusion. In real life, the shopper controls what goes into the shopping cart, so this expectation is carried to online shopping. When an ecommerce website violates this expectation, problems arise.\nFor example, Nomad Lane automatically adds shipping insurance to the total cost when users check out. Users must, first, notice this additional cost and second, actively opt out of shipping insurance. Automatic shipping insurance is not part of users\u2019 shopping cart mental model, so this leads to frustration for anyone who accidentally pays for insurance. Adding unexpected items to a shopping cart is a deceptive pattern in UX design known as\nsneaking or preselection\n.\nShipping insurance is automatically included when an item is added to the shopping cart. If users do not want shipping insurance, they must notice the additional expense and actively opt-out. This design violates users\u2019 mental models for online shopping.\nBack\nButton\nThe\nBack\nbutton is a long-standing essential in browser navigation. Over time, users have built a strong mental model for it: namely,\nBack\nis supposed to lead back to the previous screen, essentially acting as an undo.\nWhen mobile smartphones became popular, users found themselves presented with another use of the\nBack\nbutton in mobile apps. Unlike on the web, where\nBack\nwas used to take users to the previous screen, in some mobile apps,\nBack\ntook users up in the hierarchy of the site. For example, if, while the user was reading a news story A, they tapped on a link to another news story B, the\nBack\nbutton would take them to the list of all news articles instead of taking them back to the news story A.\nThis behavior violated users\u2019 expectations. Over the years, designers have luckily understood that, and now it is rare to find that implementation for\nBack\nin mobile apps. Some remnants, however, are still in place. For example, in Android, if you happen to be on the homepage of any app, doing the\nBack\ngesture (or tapping the\nBack\nbutton) will take you \u201cup\u201d \u2014 that is, outside of the app, regardless of whether you arrived to the homepage from another page inside the app or you just tapped on the app icon.\nUsing the\nBack\nbutton with an open overlay\ncan also lead to confusion. When a user opens an overlay, it feels like they are opening a new page entirely, especially when the overlay takes up the whole screen. So, when the user clicks the\nBack\nbutton, they expect to exit the overlay. However, in many cases, the user is instead taken two steps back to the page they were on before visiting the page that triggered the overlay.\nUsers expect the browser\nBack\nbutton to exit the overlay; instead, it takes them two steps back to the page visited before landing on the page that triggered the overlay.\nSearch Bars\nUsers expect to be able to input keywords and phrases into a search bar to find any information on a website. A single, well-placed search bar aligns with their expectations, offering a clear point for queries.\nWhen a website has\nseveral search features on the same page\n, users often get confused. They\u2019ll enter their query in the wrong box and assume that the site doesn\u2019t have the answer if nothing comes back. (In reality, they might have used a specialized search that doesn\u2019t cover everything.)\nIn the example below, the University of Michigan Library has two search boxes on the same page, each attached to its own database. The search box on the top right of the page is dedicated to logistical library information, while the search bar in the middle of the page is for academic research. The help text and\nplaceholder text\nassociated with each search bar allude to the purpose of each; however, users often perceive search bars as universal. The presence of multiple search bars introduces complexity and a potential for confusion.\nUniversity of Michigan Library\u2019s homepage includes two search bars \u2013 one for library logistics and the other for academic research. This type of design causes confusion, as users will often use the wrong search bar.\nMental-Model Inertia\nThere's great inertia in users' mental models\n: stuff that people know well tends to stick, even when it's not helpful. This alone is an argument for\nbeing conservative and not coming up with new interaction styles\n.\u00a0 Sometimes, you do need to innovate, but it's best to do so only when the new approach is clearly superior to the old, well-known ways.\nWhen you come up with a new design pattern, you face an immense challenge: How do you explain the new concept so users will construct a valid mental model of your system?\nIt's amazing how one misconception can thwart users throughout an entire session and cause them to systematically misinterpret everything that happens. Through failure after failure, they never question their basic assumptions. This is yet another argument for complying with preexisting user expectations whenever possible. If you don't, then make certain that you're clearly explaining what you're doing \u2014 while also realizing that you face the added challenge of users'\nreluctance to read instructions and help messages\n.\nDesigners are better off\nleveraging this mental-model inertia instead of fighting it\n. One example is skeuomorphism, a design trend that involves incorporating elements from the physical world into digital interfaces to guide users in acclimating to new interaction styles. Drawing on familiar, real-world mental models makes new, unfamiliar designs easier to understand.\nIn the realm of\nchildren's apps\n,\nskeuomorphism\nplays a particularly beneficial role. Since young users may not yet have well-established mental models for digital navigation, apps designed for kids often use physical-space metaphors, such as maps or doors, as seen in Duo ABC, an app that teaches children reading fundamentals. This approach mimics the tangible experiences that children encounter in physical spaces, like exploring a map or opening doors to discover new areas.\nDuo ABC uses skeuomorphism to guide young users who may not have mental models related to digital navigation. A door symbolizes the start of the user\u2019s journey. A map walks users through completing lessons.\nActing on Mental Models\nUnderstanding the concept of mental models can help you make sense of usability problems in your design. If people make mistakes on your site, it is often because they've formed erroneous mental models. Even if you cannot change the UI at that point, you can still teach users a more accurate mental model earlier in the user experience. Or, you might have to acknowledge that users won't understand certain distinctions and then stop making those distinctions.\nIn case of a mental model mismatch, you basically have two different options:\nMake the system conform\nto users' mental models \u2014 assuming most users\u2019 models are similar. This is the approach we usually recommend to\nfix IA problems\n: if people look for something in the wrong place, then move it to the place where they look for it.\nCard sorting\nis a useful way to discover users' mental model of an information space so that you can design your navigation accordingly.\nImprove users' mental models\nso that they more accurately reflect your system. You can, for example, explain things better and\nmake labels clearer\nto guide users to form the right model (even though the underlying system remains unchanged).\nMental models are a key concept in the development of instructions, documentation,\ntutorials\n, demos, and other\nforms of user assistance\n. All such information must be short while teaching the key concepts that people need to know to make sense of the overall system.\nOne of the main reasons we recommend the\nthink-aloud method of user testing\nis that it gives us insights into a user's mental model. When users verbalize what they think, believe, and predict while they use your design, you can piece together much of their mental models. There are more advanced\nknowledge-elicitation methods\nfor gaining deeper insights into mental models, but for most design teams, a few quick think-aloud sessions will suffice. In any case, simple\nuser testing\nis certainly the first step to take if you suspect that erroneous mental models are costing you business.\nConclusion\nMental models are an essential concept in UX design and significantly influence the decisions users make while navigating an interface. Understanding users' mental models helps designers create interfaces that resonate with users\u2019 expectations.\nRelated Courses\nUX Basic Training\nFoundational concepts that everyone should know\nInteraction\nThe Human Mind and Usability\nUse psychology to predict and explain how your customers think and act\nInteraction\nmental models,Psychology and UX,Interaction Design\nRelated Topics\nPsychology and UX\nPsychology and UX\nInteraction Design\nLearn More:\nEnable cookies\nto watch NN/g videos\nWhat Is a Mental Model?\nAurora Harley\n\u00b7\n3 min\nEndowment Effect in UX: Why Ownership Increases Engagement\nLola Famulegun\n\u00b7\n4 min\nTesler\u2019s Law: Shift Complexity to Simplify UX\nLola Famulegun\n\u00b7\n3 min\nDigital Wayfinding\nKathryn Whitenton\n\u00b7\n3 min\nRelated Articles:\nWeb UX: Study Guide\nHuei-Hsin Wang\n\u00b7\n15 min\nHow AI Works and How Users Think About It: Study Guide\nTanner Kohler\n\u00b7\n4 min\nCard Sorting: Uncover Users' Mental Models for Better Information Architecture\nSamhita Tankala and  Katie Sherwin\n\u00b7\n11 min\nCard Sorting: Pushing Users Beyond Terminology Matches\nSamhita Tankala\n\u00b7\n5 min\nMinimize Cognitive Load to Maximize Usability\nKathryn Whitenton\n\u00b7\n2 min\nProduct-Led Growth and UX\nSara Paul\n\u00b7\n6 min",
