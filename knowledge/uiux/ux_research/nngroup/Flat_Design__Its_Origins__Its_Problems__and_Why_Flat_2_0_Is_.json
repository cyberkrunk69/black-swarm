It is still widely used today, and its overuse can cause serious usability problems. One of the biggest usability issues introduced by flat design is the lack of signifiers on clickable elements. Flat 2.0 may provide a better alternative.\nFlat design is a popular design style that is\ndefined by the absence of glossy or three-dimensional visual effects\nin the graphical elements of a web page. Many designers consider it to be an offshoot of\nminimalist web design\n.\nIn This Article:\nThree-Dimensional Effects, Skeuomorphism, and Realism\nThe Origins of Flat Design\nUsability Problems with Flat Design\nFattening Flat Design\nThree-Dimensional Effects, Skeuomorphism, and Realism\nTo define flat design, we must define what flat design\nisn\u2019t.\nFlat design is commonly interpreted as a\nreactionary movement against 3D, skeuomorphic, and realistic design styles\n. A fully flat interface doesn\u2019t use any of these styles\n.\nThree-Dimensional Effects\nThree-dimensional effects give an illusion of depth to an interface, which can help users interpret visual hierarchy and understand which elements are interactive.\nElements that appear raised\nlook like they could be pressed down (clicked with the mouse). This technique is often used as a signifier for digital buttons.\nElements that appear sunken or hollow\nlook like they could be filled. This technique is often used as a signifier for input fields, like search tools.\nSince the early days of graphical user interfaces, screens have employed pseudo-three-dimensional effects (shadows, gradients, highlights) to help users understand the available actions at a glance. However, the pseudo-3D effect in these early GUIs tended to be aggressive, overdone, and visually distracting.\nThis Windows 95 dialog box made use of heavy shadows and highlights to create 3D effects. Notice how the buttons appear raised and the input fields appear sunken. It\u2019s also clear which of the three tabs is on top of the other two. However, heavy shadows can easily make an interface visually unappealing.\nSkeuomorphism\nIn digital design, a skeuomorphic design is an object that has unnecessary, ornamental design features that mimic a real-world precedent. Skeuomorphic designs are intended to help users understand how to use a new interface by allowing them to apply some prior knowledge about that precedent.\nIn earlier models of Amazon\u2019s Kindle Fire tablet, the Android-based operating system used a skeuomorphic bookshelf design, complete with 3D shelves and wood textures. The bookshelf metaphor was intended to help users transfer previous knowledge about bookshelves (as a place to store and organize physical media) to the digital environment.The shelves and wood textures are irrelevant to the system\u2019s functionality but were supposed to reinforce the metaphor. Amazon later removed the skeuomorphic bookshelf design from the UI.\nRealism\nRealism is a design style that mimics physical items or textures for aesthetic reasons.\nSkeuomorphism is often confused with\nrealism\n. In web design, the two styles are usually found together. The primary distinction is that realism is a visual style that uses design elements and textures that\nmimic the physical world for purely aesthetic purposes\n, while skeuomorphism\nsupports a metaphor\nto help users understand the interface.\nLike the earlier Kindle Fire tablets, Sprouts grocery website uses 3D wood textures, but the realism in this design is only for aesthetic appeal. It does not serve to support any kind of metaphor to help users understand how to use the interface, nor does it mimic any real-world predecessor.\nThe Origins of Flat Design\nThe release of Microsoft\u2019s Metro design language and Windows 8 in 2011 was particularly influential in popularizing flat design. Microsoft\u2019s design documentation referred to its new style as \"authentically digital\" \u2014 a phrase that neatly captures the appeal of flat design for many designers. Unlike skeuomorphic design, flat design was seen as a way to explore the digital medium without trying to reproduce the appearance of the physical world.\nThe flattening of Apple\u2019s homepage provides a useful benchmark for the growth of the trend\u2019s popularity. Skeuomorphism and realism had long been trademarks of Apple design, and its homepage resisted the flat trend until around 2013.\nApple\u2019s homepage in 2007 (via WayBack Machine). The navigation bar is styled to appear as glossy, 3D tabs.\nApple\u2019s homepage in 2012 (via WayBack Machine). The tabs metaphor is gone, but the navigation bar still appears glossy and rounded (an example of realism rather than skeuomorphism). The new search tool has inset shadows to make it appear hollow (a more elegant visual effect than the appearance of the Windows input fields 17 years earlier, but conceptually the same idea). The icons visible in the lower-right corner are so glossy that they almost interfere with the viewer\u2019s ability to understand what they are. These buttons almost appear to be glowing, rather than raised.\nApple\u2019s homepage in 2015. The entire navigation bar, including the logo, is entirely flat \u2014 no detectable shadows, textures, or highlights. There are no 3D, realistic, or skeuomorphic effects here. The only way users know that the navigation options are clickable is by convention: a strongly colored stripe across the top of a web page tends to be a navigation bar (except when it\u2019s an ad, but this one is too thin to fall victim to\nbanner blindness\n).\nUsability Problems with Flat Design\nSince flat design\u2019s emergence in 2011, Nielsen Norman Group has been a\nvocal critic of its inherent usability issues\n. Our\nprimary objection to flat design\nis that it tends to sacrifice users\u2019 needs for the sake of trendy aesthetics.\nFor years, users had been exposed to traditional\nsignifiers\nof clickability, such as blue, underlined links and 3D effects on buttons. As design trends shift and users are exposed to new patterns, the average user\u2019s ability to intuitively\nidentify linked elements\nhas evolved. But just because users are better at detecting linked elements doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t need any clues\nat all.\nIn fact, we've noticed that long-term exposure to these flat yet clickable elements has been\nslowly reducing user efficiency\nby complicating their understanding of what's clickable and what isn't.\nWhen we asked a 22-year-old Canadian how she knew what she could click on in websites, she gave the following answer:\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s blue and underlined, that\u2019s how you know initially. You see that even in Word and stuff. But really, especially when it\u2019s underlined, that helps. Or if it\u2019s a button, it doesn\u2019t have to say Click Here, but if it says, Buy Now or Purchase or Add to Cart.\u201d\nThis quote neatly illustrates the types of cues people use to determine clickability:\nTraditional, externally consistent signifiers (such as the blue, underlined text or raised buttons)\nSomething reminiscent of a traditional signifier (such as underlined text of any color or boxed text)\nContextual clues (such as actionable text or placement at the top of the page)\nThe homepage of Trader Joe\u2019s displays a variety of clickability signifiers. (1) The blue, underlined text of\nView All\nis a traditional signifier. (2) The flat, red background on the\nFind\nlink is reminiscent of a button, even without 3D or realistic visual effects. (3) The black links in the main navigation bar communicate their clickability only by their placement and text. (Note that the mostly flat page does have one element of skeuomorphism \u2014 the wooden shelf under the featured product carousel.)\nIf your organization wants to transition to a flatter aesthetic, follow our\nguidelines for designing recognizably clickable elements\nto make sure you aren\u2019t causing click uncertainty.\nFattening Flat Design\nRecently, designers have begun to notice the usability issues of flat design. As a result, a more mature and balanced interpretation of flat design has emerged. Designers are finding they can be \"authentically digital\" and explore the unique opportunities of the medium without compromising usability.\nThis newer interpretation is sometimes referred to as\n\"semi flat,\" \"almost flat,\" or \"flat 2.0.\"\nThis design style is mostly flat, but it makes use of subtle shadows, highlights, and layers to create some depth in the UI.\nFlat design elements with long shadows, as seen in this designer\u2019s portfolio, became popular around 2013. Long shadows are one example of flat 2.0 gone wrong \u2014 the 3D effects are purely aesthetic and don\u2019t add any meaningful information for users. Thankfully, their popularity has declined, but icons with long shadows are still in use in some flat interfaces.\nGoogle\u2019s\nMaterial design\nlanguage is one example of flat 2.0 with the right priorities: it uses consistent metaphors and principles borrowed from physics to help users make sense of interfaces and interpret visual hierarchies in content.\nThe Evernote app for Android is a good example of the possible benefits of flat 2.0. Despite having a mostly flat UI, the app provides a few subtle shadows on the navigation bar and the floating + button (add new). It also makes use of the card metaphor to display content as flat, layerable panes in a 3D space.\nAs with any design trend, we advise balance and moderation. Don\u2019t make design decisions that sacrifice usability for trendiness.\nDon\u2019t forget that \u2014 unless you\u2019re designing\nonly\nfor other designers \u2014 you are not the user\n. Your preferences and ability to interpret clickability signifiers aren\u2019t the same as your users\u2019 because you\nknow\nwhat each element in your own design is intended to do.\nEarly pseudo-3D GUIs and Steve-Jobs-esque skeuomorphism often produced heavy, clunky interfaces.\nScaling back from those excesses is good for usability\n. But removing visual distinctions to produce fully flat designs with no signifiers can be an equally bad extreme.\nFlat 2.0 provides an opportunity for compromise\n\u2014 visual simplicity without sacrificing signifiers.\nIf your UI uses a flat design, make sure you\nfollow the best practices\nto avoid its pitfalls.\nRelated Courses\nWeb Page UX Design\nStrategically combine content, visuals, and interactive components to design successful web pages\nInteraction\nThe Human Mind and Usability\nUse psychology to predict and explain how your customers think and act\nInteraction\nflat design,Visual Design,skeuomorphism,Web Usability,signifiers\nRelated Topics\nVisual Design\nVisual Design\nWeb Usability\nLearn More:\nEnable cookies\nto watch NN/g videos\nFlat Design Decreases User Efficiency\nKate Moran\n\u00b7\n2 min\nValidate Your Visual Design: 6 Methods\nMegan Brown\n\u00b7\n5 min\nAnatomy of Good Icons\nKelley Gordon\n\u00b7\n3 min\nFlat UI Elements Lack Clickability Clues and Cause Confusion\nKate Moran\n\u00b7\n5 min\nRelated Articles:\nFlat-Design Best Practices\nKate Moran\n\u00b7\n6 min\nFlat UI Elements Attract Less Attention and Cause Uncertainty\nKate Moran\n\u00b7\n11 min\nTypography Terms: Glossary\nSarah Gibbons and  Therese Fessenden\n\u00b7\n7 min\nYoung Adults Appreciate Flat Design More than Their Parents Do\nKate Moran\n\u00b7\n5 min\nLong-Term Exposure to Flat Design: How the Trend Slowly Decreases User Efficiency\nKate Moran\n\u00b7\n8 min\nThe Characteristics of Minimalism in Web Design\nKate Moran\n\u00b7\n12 min",
