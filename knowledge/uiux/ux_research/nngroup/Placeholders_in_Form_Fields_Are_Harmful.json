It also poses additional burdens for users with visual and cognitive impairments.\nIn-context descriptions or hints can help clarify what goes inside each form field, and therefore improve completion and\nconversion rates\n. There are many ways to provide hints. A common implementation is by inserting instructions within form fields. Unfortunately, user testing continually shows that\nplaceholders in form fields often hurt usability\nmore than help it.\nIn This Article:\nLabels and Placeholders\nPlaceholders that Replace Labels\nPlaceholder Text in Addition to Labels\nPlaceholders and Accessibility\nFloating Labels\nConclusion\nLabels and Placeholders\nLabels tell users what information belongs in a given form field and are usually positioned outside the form field. Placeholder text, located inside a form field, is an additional hint, description, or example of the information required for a particular field. These hints typically disappear when the user types in the field.\nPlaceholders that Replace Labels\nSome forms replace field labels with in-field placeholder text to reduce clutter on the page, or to shorten the length of the form. While this approach is based on good intentions, our research shows that it has many negative consequences.\nWorst: In this example, placeholder text is used instead of a label.\nBelow are 7 main reasons why placeholders should not be used as replacements for field labels.\n1. Disappearing placeholder text strains users\u2019\nshort-term memory\n.\nIf the user forgets the hint, which people often do while filling out long forms, he has to delete what he wrote and, in some cases, click away from the field to reveal the placeholder text again. In an ideal world, users would be entirely focused when filling out a form. But in reality,\nusers multitask\n. They\nhave different tabs open\n, or they might be pulled away by an email or phone call. For complex tasks, they might have to stop and go retrieve a document or order number. From our\nresearch on mobile usability\n, we know that mobile users are also frequently distracted and interrupted while using their devices. So, it\u2019s important to help users pick up where they left off.\nOn simple, frequently used forms with one or two fields, such as a search box or login form, the strain on memory is less of an issue than with complex or rarely used forms. That is because with simple, familiar forms, users can guess what they are supposed to enter. Although, on even a simple login form without labels, users may not remember if they have the option to type\nUsername or Email\nor just\nUsername.\n2. Without labels, users cannot check their work before submitting a form.\nThe lack of labels makes it impossible for customers to glance through the form and make sure that their responses are correct. Similarly, browsers that\nautocomplete form fields may fill in information incorrectly.\nIf there are no labels, or if special instructions are no longer visible, customers must reveal the placeholder text by deleting the text in each field one by one in order verify that it matches the description. Realistically though, many won\u2019t even realize that potential for error, and they won\u2019t make the effort to double check.\n3. When error messages occur, people don\u2019t know how to fix the problem.\nIf the form has been filled out, but there are no labels or instructions visible outside the form fields, then users have to go back to each field to reveal the description in order to fix the error.\n4. Placeholder text that disappears when the cursor is placed in a form field is irritating for users\nnavigating with the keyboard\n.\nPeople using the\nTab\nkey move quickly from field to field, and they don\u2019t stop to study the next field before tabbing to it.\n5. Fields with stuff in them are less noticeable.\nEyetracking\nstudies show that\nusers\u2019 eyes are drawn to empty fields\n. At the minimum, users will spend more time locating a non-empty field \u2014 a\nnuisance\n. At the worst, they will overlook the field completely\u2014a potential business-killing disaster.\n6. Users may mistake a placeholder for data that was automatically filled in.\nWhen there is already text in the field, people are less likely to realize that they can type there. Some users assume the placeholder text is a default value and\nskip the field completely\n.\n7. Occasionally users have to delete placeholder text manually.\nSometimes placeholders do not disappear when users move their input focus into the field. If the placeholder remains in the field as\neditable text\n, users are forced to manually select and delete it. This creates an unnecessary burden on users and increases the\ninteraction cost\nof filling in the form.\nSometimes the placeholder dims when the cursor is placed in a text field. Unfortunately, this interaction pattern is rare and users are not familiar with it: some still think they have to delete the text manually. It often takes a few failed attempts and lots of clicking to realize that they can start typing over the dimmed text.\nPlaceholder Text in Addition to Labels\nUsing placeholder text in combination with form labels is a step in the right direction. Labels outside the form fields make the essential information visible at all times, while placeholder text inside form fields is reserved for supplementary information. However, even when using labels, placing important hints or instructions within a form field\ncan still cause the 7 issues mentioned above\n, albeit with less severity. If some of the fields require an extra description that is\nessential\nto completing the form correctly, it\u2019s best to place that text outside the field so that it is always visible.\nBetter: Here, placeholder text is used as a hint in addition to the label.\nPlaceholders and Accessibility\nOne last issue to consider is that placeholder text is generally\nbad for\naccessibility\n. Certainly, accessibility software and modern browsers are improving, but they still have a long way to go. Three of the biggest problems for accessibility are as follows:\nThe default light-grey color of placeholder text has poor color contrast against most backgrounds.\nFor users with a visual impairment, poor color contrast makes it difficult to read the text. Because not all browsers allow placeholder text to be styled using CSS, this is a difficult issue to mitigate.\nUsers with cognitive or motor impairments are more heavily burdened.\nAs we saw, placeholders can be problematic for all users: disappearing placeholders increase the memory load; persistent dimmable placeholders cause confusion when they look clickable but aren\u2019t, and placeholders that do not disappear require more keyboard or mouse interaction to be deleted. These difficulties are magnified for people with cognitive or motor impairments.\nNot all screen readers read placeholder text aloud\n. Blind or visually impaired users may miss the hint completely if their software does not speak the placeholder content.\nFloating Labels\nRooted in\nminimalist web design\n, the floating-label pattern is a modified approach to placeholders that mitigates some of the disadvantages of traditional placeholders. This pattern has been around for years, but it has finally made way onto mainstream websites, and it has even been officially embraced by Google's Material Design.\nIn this pattern, labels are placed within the form field as placeholders until the field becomes active and the user moves the input focus into the field. At that point, the placeholder label moves to the top of the field. As a result, the floating label (also known as an adaptive placeholder) is always visible, either in the center of the form field, or above the text that the user entered.\nGood: Floating labels move to the top of the form field when the user selects it to start typing (Warbyparker.com).\nThere are two main advantages to this approach:\nIt can save space on mobile devices, by not requiring extra vertical space to put the label above the field.\nThe visible label serves as a memory aid while people are in the typing stage. This therefore addresses points 1-4 from the list of pitfalls above.\nHowever,\nissues #5 and #6 from above are still a problem\n: fields with text in them are less noticeable, and users might think there is already a default value entered in the field. Also, the accessibility issues described earlier may still apply, because some browsers and assistive technologies don\u2019t properly or reliably read placeholder text.\nUltimately, floating labels do offer a better user experience than the label as a placeholder. But if you have the screen space, placing the label and hint outside the field is still the best way to go.\nConclusion\nRather than risk having users stumble while filling out forms or waste valuable time figuring out how they work, the best solution is to have clear, visible labels that are placed outside empty form fields.\nBest: The label and hint are placed outside the form field and are always visible to the user.\nHints and instructions should also be persistent and placed outside of the field. Forms are an important part of many\nconversion goals\n, so it\u2019s worthwhile to make sure that your users can get through them quickly and accurately.\nRelated Courses\nWeb Page UX Design\nStrategically combine content, visuals, and interactive components to design successful web pages\nInteraction\nApplication Design for Web and Desktop\nComponents, design patterns, workflows, and ways of interacting with complex data\nInteraction\nThe Human Mind and Usability\nUse psychology to predict and explain how your customers think and act\nInteraction\nforms,Accessibility,Application Design,Web Usability\nRelated Topics\nAccessibility\nAccessibility\nApplication Design\nWeb Usability\nLearn More:\nEnable cookies\nto watch NN/g videos\nPlaceholders in Form Fields Are Harmful\nKatie Sherwin\n\u00b7\n3 min\nSemantic Differential Scales: Measure User Attitudes with Nuance\nRachel Banawa\n\u00b7\n4 min\nOverflow Menu Icons\nKate Kaplan\n\u00b7\n4 min\nBetter Forms Through Visual Organization\nKathryn Whitenton\n\u00b7\n3 min\nRelated Articles:\nWebsite Forms Usability:  Top 10 Recommendations\nKathryn Whitenton\n\u00b7\n6 min\nInclusive Design\nAlita Kendrick\n\u00b7\n6 min\nReset and Cancel Buttons\nJakob Nielsen\n\u00b7\n5 min\nContextual Menus: Delivering Relevant Tools for Tasks\nAnna Kaley\n\u00b7\n7 min\n6 Tips for Successful Personalization\nAmy Schade\n\u00b7\n6 min\nA Checklist for Designing Mobile Input Fields\nRaluca Budiu\n\u00b7\n2 min",
