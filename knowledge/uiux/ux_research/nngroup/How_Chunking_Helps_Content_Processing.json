UX professionals can break their text and multimedia content into smaller chunks to help users process, understand, and remember it better.\nIn This Article:\nChunks and Chunking\nChunking Text Content\nChunking Multimedia Content\nConclusion\nChunks and Chunking\nChunk:\nA piece or part of something larger. In the field of cognitive psychology, a chunk is an\norganizational unit in memory\n.\nChunks can have varying levels of activation \u2014 meaning they can be easier or more difficult to\nrecall\n. When information enters memory, it can be recoded so that related concepts are grouped together into one such chunk. This process is called\nchunking\n, and is often used as a memorization technique. For example, a chunked phone number (+1-919-555-2743) is easier to remember (and scan) than a long string of unchunked digits (19195552743).\nChunk (UX):\nIn the field of user-experience design, \u2018\nchunking\n\u2019 usually refers to\nbreaking up content into small, distinct units of information\n(or \u2018chunks\u2019), as opposed to presenting an undifferentiated mess of atomic information items.\nPresenting content in chunks makes scanning easier for users and can improve their\nability to comprehend\nand\nremember it\n. In practice, chunking is about\ncreating meaningful, visually distinct content units that make sense in the context of the larger whole\n.\nChunking Text Content\nUsers appreciate chunked text content. It helps avoid walls of text, which can appear intimidating or time-consuming. Chunking enables easy skimming \u2014 users\u2019 preferred method of\nreading online\n.\nSome of the most commonly used methods of chunking text content are:\nShort paragraphs, with white space to separate them\nShort text lines of text (around 50\u201375 characters)\nClear visual hierarchies with related items grouped together\nDistinct groupings in strings of letters or numbers such as\npasswords\n, license keys, credit-card or account numbers, phone numbers, and dates (for example, 14487324534 vs 1 (448) 732 4534)\nChunked strings should use the most conventional format for each data type to minimize\nuser slips\n. For example, credit card numbers are usually presented in 4 chunks of 4 digits each (e.g., 4111 1111 1111 1111 instead of 4111111111111111). Be aware that the standard format for some strings will vary by country.\n+65-5555-5555\n(01) 55 1234 5678\n(919)-555-5555\nSingapore\nMexico\nUnited States\nSample chunking formats for telephone numbers in three countries.\nAlthough formatting improves scannability, it does make typing more difficult. Users should not have to type in formatting characters; instead, forms should use\nautoformattting \u2014\ninput fields should automatically chunk your users\u2019 input.\nApartments.com: This contact form for a real-estate website appropriately chunks the agency\u2019s phone number at the top. The phone-number input is chunked automatically as the user types a string of digits. (Note, however, that we recommend against displaying the field labels within the input boxes.)\nSimply chunking your text isn\u2019t enough \u2014 you also need to support scanning by making it easy to quickly identify the main points of the chunks. You can do this by including:\nHeadings and subheadings that clearly contrast with the rest of the text (bolder, larger, etc.)\nHighlighted keywords (bold, italic, etc.)\nBulleted or numbered lists\nA short summary paragraph for longer sections of text, such as articles\nApartmentGuide.com: This wall of text on the homepage of a real-estate search engine has long lines of text, no highlighting, and no subheadings. One user saw this unchunked wall of text and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of writing down here. I\u2019m not interested in this. It makes it look messy.\u201d The three words she used to describe this page were: \u201cBusy,\u201d \u201cwordy,\u201d and \u201cunwelcoming.\u201d\nBBC uses short paragraphs, lots of white space, subheadings, and a short summary to chunk this article. Each topic subheading also has a subtle horizontal rule and a related photograph to help further delineate between sections. One user took a few seconds to look over the page and said, \u201cI feel that this is very nicely split up. I\u2019m positive that it\u2019s an easy read. It said what were the five [topics covered in the article], and then split them up.\u201d She then proceeded to actually read the entire article \u2014 which perhaps says more about the success of their chunking than her comment.\nChunking Multimedia Content\nThe key to effectively chunking multimedia content (text as well as images, graphics, videos, buttons, and other elements) is to keep related things close together and aligned (in accordance with the\nLaw of Proximity\nin Gestalt psychology). Using background colors, horizontal rules, and white space can help users visually distinguish between what\u2019s related and what isn\u2019t.\nMailChimp\u2019s\nminimalist design\nrelies on subtle methods of indicating chunks. The paragraphs and subheadings are clearly related by their proximity. Their shared width creates invisible alignment (the subheading and paragraph text both sit in a 500px-wide HTML container). At a glance, it\u2019s harder to distinguish which chunk of text describes the screenshot in the middle. When looking more carefully you may notice that the image is closer to the top paragraph.\nOther types of content (such as videos or graphics) can also be chunked. Just remember that the main idea of chunking is\nto divide information into clearly distinct groups of related content.\nFor example, you can chunk video content into individually accessible chapters or topics, to allow users to easily navigate inside the video. Or you can group related tools in a crowded application toolbar to help users remember where to find them.\nTED.com: An interactive video transcript chunks a long video into individual, navigable segments. Users can scan the text and jump to different points in the video. This transcript misses an opportunity, however\u2014subheadings and highlighted text would help call out the main ideas of each chunk and better support navigation.\nThe Mythical Number Seven\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of the \u2018magical number seven,\u2019 made famous by cognitive psychologist George Miller. In 1956, Miller found that most people can\nremember about 7 chunks\nof information in their short-term memory. What Miller found interesting, however, was not the number 7 itself. Instead, he was fascinated by the fact that the size of the chunks did not seem to matter \u2014 people could remember 7 individual letters, or 28 letters if they were grouped into 7 four-letter words. (In the former case, each unrelated letter counts as a chunk, whereas in the latter case, each word is a chunk.)\nIn the field of user experience, Miller\u2019s magical number seven is often misunderstood to mean that humans can only process seven chunks at any given time. As a consequence, confused designers will sometimes misuse this finding to justify unnecessary design limitations.\nFor example, a designer may refuse to add more than seven options in a global navigation bar for fear of violating the magical number seven. However,\nthe point of menus\nis reliance on\nrecognition rather than recall\n: users don\u2019t need to keep all of the menu items in their short-term memory, because all the available options are continuously displayed on the screen. So there are no usability gains to be made by limiting the number of menu items to seven.\nMenus can still be easy to use\nwith more than seven choices, as long as the options are structured in a meaningful way.\nThe main takeaway from Miller\u2019s research for UX professionals should be this:\nHuman short-term memory is limited\n, so if you want your users to retain more, pack information into meaningful chunks.\nDon\u2019t ask your users to hold more than a few pieces of information in their short-term memory at once. And don\u2019t get hung up on the number seven \u2014 Miller himself titled his paper \u201cThe Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information.\u201d Other researchers have suggested that the right number could be anywhere from three to six.\nWhatever the\naverage\ncapacity of short-term memory may be, the\nspecific\ncapacity for individual humans will vary (it's one of the many causes for the\nhuge variability in user performance\n). You could be one of the \u201cplus-one\u201d or \u201cplus-two\u201d people, especially if you\u2019re a developer who makes a living from keeping lots of information in memory at once. (No, it's not that programming computers makes your brain grow until it strains against your skull. Rather, it's only people born with high-capacity brains who are attracted to a career that requires them to retain a lot of items in memory.) In contrast, many of your customers could easily be \u201cminus-one\u201d or \u201cminus-two\u201d people, which means that they will have great difficulty remembering things that you might find easy. The short-term\u2013memory limits will additionally be impacted by users\u2019 context: where they are and what else is happening around them while they use your interface. This point is discussed further in our\nUX Basic Training\ncourse and is one of the key reasons you can\u2019t judge ease of use purely on the basis on whether you personally feel a design is easy to use.\nhp.com: This e-commerce site uses a subtle background color and negative space to help users visually distinguish between each chunk (each laptop), but displays 21 options on a single page. This decision works fine, because users will probably browse or search on this page, and they won\u2019t need to remember each individual laptop.\nConclusion\nChunking is critical for presenting content that users can comprehend and remember easily. Use chunking for text and multimedia content alike to help users understand underlying relationships and information hierarchy.\nReference\nGeorge A. Miller, 1956.
