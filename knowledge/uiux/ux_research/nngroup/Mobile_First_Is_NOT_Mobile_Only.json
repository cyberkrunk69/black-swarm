Porting an unchanged UI to a different platform hurts UX.\nIn a\nrecent study\n, we found that hiding navigation under a menu significantly decreases the use of the navigation and also degrades the overall user experience both on desktop and on mobile.\nWhile hiding navigation under an expandable menu can be a necessity on a small mobile device, it is not a practice that is native to the desktop; rather, it is a trend inspired by mobile and reinforced by\nresponsive design\n, a technology that allows the same content and functionality to be present on different screen sizes, but rearranged in layouts that are appropriate to the available screen spaces. Many responsive sites use a mobile-first approach to designing for multiple devices: they start with a design that is optimized for mobile and then port it to the desktop, under the assumption that simple is better across all devices, and a design that is simple and condensed enough so that it works for small screens will also provide a good user experience on large ones.\nIn this article we examine the consequences of porting mobile-first designs to the desktop, with a focus on navigation.\nIn This Article:\nAbout Our Study\nNavigation Usage: More on Mobile than on Desktop?\nDesign Patterns Borrowed from Mobile\nOptimize for Each Device\nPorting User Interfaces Creates Terrible User Experience\nAbout Our Study\nNN/g partnered with international remote-usability-testing firm,\nWhatUsersDo\n, to test 3 different types of navigation: hidden, visible, and a combination of hidden and visible navigation. As described in the\nstudy methodology\n, 179 users participated in our study; they completed tasks on 6 different websites, on desktops and smartphones:\n7digital (music, e-commerce)\nBBC (news)\nBloomberg Business (business news)\nBusiness Insider UK (business news)\nSupermarket HQ (e-commerce)\nSlate (news)\nFor each site, we designed two types of tasks that involved finding specific content:\nA navigation-optional task,\nwhich could be accomplished without using the navigation or search on the site, by simply selecting an item on the homepage\nA navigation-required task,\nwhich could only be accomplished through the use of navigation (or search \u2014 so even these tasks could be done without navigation)\nAll the sites in our study were responsive, with the exception of Business Insider UK. By looking at the patterns that all of these sites employed, whether responsive or not, (e.g., the use of hidden navigation, repeating the navigation at the bottom of the page, using a search icon instead of a search box), we also surmise that most if not all of these sites were designed using mobile-first principles.\nAs discussed in our other articles, we collected several metrics; here, we focus on one of them: navigation use. This measure captured whether participants clicked on the navigation options during their tasks.\nNavigation Usage: More on Mobile than on Desktop?\nWhen we look at the differences between mobile and desktop navigation use, it is highly surprising that, on the sites that we included in our study, the\nnavigation was used a lot more on mobile\nthan on desktop\n. (This difference was statistically significant with a paired t-test, p <0.05.) Not only that, but comparing the navigation use on each site, on 5 out of the 6 sites, the navigation was used significantly more on mobile than on the desktop. (These differences were significant by N-1 2 proportion tests.) The exception was 7Digital, where we also recorded more navigation use on mobile but the difference was not statistically significant, and thus may just have been random.\nNavigation usage was higher on the mobile versions of the sites than on the desktop versions of the sites.\nThis result is unexpected for several reasons:\nMaking navigation\neasy to access\nis a notoriously hard task on mobile. Mobile pages are long and often as soon as users scroll down the first screenful, navigation placed at the top of the page is no longer visible. If they want to access it, they have to scroll back. (Sticky navigation or back-to-top buttons are sometimes used to alleviate this problem, but they often get ignored by users.)\nMaking navigation\ndiscoverable\nis also notoriously difficult on mobile. Lucky sites that only have 4\u20135 options in their main navigation can afford to make these options visible at the top of the screen, but the majority of sites must hide at least some of the navigation under an expandable menu. Because these menus hide a wide variety of items, by necessity, they have vague labels such as\nMenu\nor\nBrowse\nwith low\ninformation scent\n. Users must actively think about turning to them as a problem-solving strategy when they are in trouble; they are not\nprimed\nby a label that resembles the content that they are looking for. As a result, people often ignore these menus, and sometimes they forget about them even after they\u2019ve used them once within the same session.\nSo how is it possible that on this platform with hard-to-use navigation, the navigation is still used a lot more than on the desktop? Did the mobile sites in our sample have exceptionally good navigation designs? If you look at the individual sites, you\u2019ll see that they were not much different from the many navigation implementations on countless other mobile sites: either the much reviled hamburger menu or an homologue, plus, in some cases, a number of visible navigation links.\nNo. The proper way of describing our findings is not that these sites had discovered the secret of\nmobile navigation\nor that there was more navigation on mobile (in fact, the overall navigation usage on mobile was only a modest 63%), but, rather, that there was\nless navigation on the desktop\n. While these two statements are logically the same, the twist in perspective allocates the guilt where it belongs: to the desktop user interfaces, which were not up to the demands of this platform.\nAnd why were the desktop designs worse? Because they were ported from a different platform \u2014 mobile. In other words, all of these sites were likely built to be mobile-first: they were optimized for mobile, and as a result the desktop user experience suffered significantly.\nYou can perhaps think of another possible explanation for why the navigation was used more on mobile. Because the mobile screen is too small and shows only a little content at the time, users have to scroll more to get the same amount of content that is displayed on a desktop screen. (That is indeed, a consequence of the fact that the\nmobile\u2013user communication channel is narrower in capacity\n, and it\u2019s also the reason why\ncomprehension is poorer on mobile\n). So maybe mobile users got tired of scrolling, so they decided to use navigation instead of fishing around for information on the page. That may be true; however, remember that our study included both navigation-required and navigation-optional tasks. If people were simply tired of scrolling on mobile, you\u2019d expect to see more navigation use on mobile for the navigation-optional tasks that could be accomplished by clicking on a link on the homepage. But there should be no difference between mobile and desktop for the navigation-required tasks, that required the use of navigation to be completed.\nBut our data says otherwise: we found statistically significant differences for mobile and desktops for each type of tasks, both navigation-dependent and navigation independent. In other words, the reason why people used navigation less on the desktop was\nnot\nthat they didn\u2019t need it; even in those situations where they couldn\u2019t accomplish the task without the navigation, they used it in only 54% of the times, compared to 77% on mobile.\nNavigation usage was higher on mobile irrespective of task type. Navigation-dependent tasks that required the use of navigation to be completed had an overall higher rate of navigation use. However, the navigation usage was still higher on mobile than on desktop even for these tasks.\nDesign Patterns Borrowed from Mobile\nWhich were some of the more important mobile-design patterns that the sites in our study borrowed for the desktop?\nHidden navigation\n. Perhaps the expandable navigation menu (such as the hamburger menu) was the biggest offender and certainly the mobile-inspired pattern most relevant to our study. We\u2019ve seen from many qualitative studies that\nit doesn\u2019t work on the desktop\n, but sites still insist on using it.\nRepeated navigation at the bottom of the screen.\nOne of the sites (7Digital) in our study has an expandable navigation menu at the top of the page and also repeats the navigation options at the bottom of the screen. This practice is often used on mobile to prevent users from having to scroll back to the top of the page to access the navigation positioned there.\nSticky navigation at the top of the page.\nSome desktop sites (e.g., Bloomberg, Business Insider UK) chose to make the navigation sticky: that is, it remained present at the top of the page as users scrolled down or when they started to scroll up.\nNavigation in the top right corner.\nOne of the desktop sites (Slate) placed the navigation in a highly nonstandard position for the desktop: the top right corner. This placement for the hamburger menu is a lot more common on mobile (where, in apps, the top left corner is often reserved for the\nBack\nbutton).\nSearch icon instead of search box.\nMany of the sites also got rid of the search box on the desktop and preferred to use a search icon instead. We generally\nrecommend against this practice on the desktop\n; we\u2019ve heard countless users complaining about having to locate a tiny icon on a large screen.\nSlate desktop (left) and mobile (right): the desktop site used a hamburger menu at the top of the right rail, in the top right corner of the page, a position highly nonstandard for desktop but fairly common on mobile. It also displayed a search icon instead of the traditional search box that people expect on the desktop.\nBBC desktop (left) and mobile (right): The desktop site used a navigation bar with a\nMore\ntab \u2014 similar with the\nMore\ntab used to fit extra tabs in the iOS tab bar.\nBusiness Insider desktop (left) and mobile (right): The desktop site used a hamburger menu for the desktop global navigation. The top blue bar was sticky: it stayed at the top of the page as the user scrolled down. Other mobile-inspired featured were the image-based, information-depleted layout and the search icon instead of a search box.\nNone of these patterns are either common or particularly usable or useful on desktop, yet they often work or are necessary on mobile. These sites found them valuable for their small-screen designs, and thought they should apply them to the desktop. Little did they know that they were throwing the baby out with the bath water: the desktop user experience suffered, and they created unnecessary problems.\nOptimize for Each Device\nIn our world of many interconnected devices, it is imperative to design for all of them. Agreed, it seems wasteful to have separate designs for every single device. But, different devices have different capabilities of interaction and different screen sizes. The amount of information that can be displayed on each of these devices at a time varies wildly and the same design will have a very different\ncontent-to-chrome ratio\non two different devices. For example, on a small mobile screen, a hamburger icon may be noticeable enough, but if you move the same icon to a large 27\u201d screen, it will easily get lost.\nGranted, you could make the hamburger bigger, like in the image below, which shows Slate\u2019s homepage if the hamburger icon were sized to take the same fraction of the desktop screen as it does on an iPhone 6S. But we don\u2019t advise you to use a design like this for several reasons:\nRight-aligned logos work worse than left-aligned logos\n(but we retained the right-alignment here for the sake of comparison).\nIcons this huge may still be overlooked due to\nbanner blindness\n.\nIf you do allocate this much space to navigation, you might as well show the links.\nSlate desktop homepage, as tested (left) and with icons resized to take up the same percentage of the screen on a 27-inch monitor as they do on an iPhone 6 screen (right). Since a good 27-inch monitor costs $180, it\u2019s currently a typical purchase for business users.\nWe cannot ignore these differences when scaling user interfaces. We must take advantage of individual device strengths in order to produce designs that work across all screen sizes.\nPorting User Interfaces Creates Terrible User Experience\nThe history of user interface design has many examples of people replying on the shortcut of porting a UI from one platform to another. It never works:\n1980s: Taking a DOS program and porting it to Windows translates into a miserable user experience, as the resulting software doesn\u2019t integrate GUI direct-manipulation features properly.\n1990s: Taking a Windows program and porting it to Macintosh results in a substandard user experience, as the application doesn\u2019t feel like a native Mac program. The look-and-feel is simply wrong, and the Apple magazines of the day rightfully savaged such ports in their reviews.\n2000s: Taking a brochure or other print collateral and making it into a website results in a sluggish user experience, with little use of interactive features and impoverished navigation. Porting print content to online by making it into a\nPDF blob\nis even worse.\nLate 2000s: Taking a website optimized for desktop use and offering it to mobile users results in an almost unusable user experience, as people get lost in overly elaborate menus and content that doesn\u2019t fit the small screen.\n2010: Taking a magazine designed for paper and\nporting it to the iPad\nresults in a dreadful user experience, with users stuck into a nonhyperlinked world and crushed by the print metaphor.\nLate 2010s: Taking a website optimized for mobile use and offering it to desktop users results in a degraded user experience, as we have seen in this article.\n2020? Taking a mobile app and cramming it onto a\nwatch will also be terrible\n. Let\u2019s hope that history won\u2019t repeat itself, though it surely will.\nTempting as it may be to design once and use twice, it can result in a subpar user experience for one of the platforms, and maybe for both of them. Providing content and feature parity across devices is a great goal, but it doesn\u2019t mean that all the UI elements and the design must also stay exactly the same. Each UI platform has different capabilities leading to different design requirements for an optimized user experience. Serving users on multiple platforms requires a multiplatform design strategy.\nOther Articles Related to the NN/g Hidden-Navigation Study\nHamburger Menus and Hidden Navigation Hurt UX Metrics\nHidden- and Visible-Navigation Study: Methodology\nHow to Make Navigation (Even Hamburger) Discoverable on Mobile\nBeyond the Hamburger: How to Make Navigation Discoverable on Desktops\nLearn more about scaling user interfaces across different devices in our full-day\ncourse\n.\nRelated Courses\nMobile User Experience\nEssential UX design principles for small-screen websites and apps\nInteraction\nWeb Page UX Design\nStrategically combine content, visuals, and interactive components to design successful web pages\nInteraction\nThe Human Mind and Usability\nUse psychology to predict and explain how your customers think and act\nInteraction\nhamburger,mobile navigation,Mobile & Tablet,Navigation,Web Usability\nRelated Topics\nMobile & Tablet\nMobile & Tablet\nNavigation\nWeb Usability\nLearn More:\nGrids 101\nKelley Gordon\n\u00b7\n4 min\nHamburger Menu Icon Update\nKate Kaplan\n\u00b7\n3 min\n2-Factor Authentication (2-FA)\nTim Neusesser\n\u00b7\n4 min\nRelated Articles:\nHamburger Menus and Hidden Navigation Hurt UX Metrics\nKara Pernice and  Raluca Budiu\n\u00b7\n12 min\nSupporting Mobile Navigation in Spite of a Hamburger Menu\nAmy Schade\n\u00b7\n4 min\nList Thumbnails on Mobile: When to Use Them and Where to Place Them\nAurora Harley\n\u00b7\n4 min\nBasic Patterns for Mobile Navigation: A Primer\nRaluca Budiu\n\u00b7\n7 min\nDon\u2019t Use Split Buttons for Navigation Menus\nRaluca Budiu\n\u00b7\n9 min\nVisual Indicators to Differentiate Items in a List\nAurora Harley\n\u00b7\n6 min",

The look-and-feel is simply wrong, and the Apple magazines of the day rightfully savaged such ports in their reviews.\n- 2000s: Taking a brochure or other print collateral and making it into a website results in a sluggish user experience, with little use of interactive features and impoverished navigation. Porting print content to online by making it into a [PDF blob](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/pdf-unfit-for-human-consumption/) is even worse.\n- Late 2000s: Taking a website optimized for desktop use and offering it to mobile users results in an almost unusable user experience, as people get lost in overly elaborate menus and content that doesn\u2019t fit the small screen.\n- 2010: Taking a magazine designed for paper and [porting it to the iPad](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ipad-usability-first-findings/) results in a dreadful user experience, with users stuck into a nonhyperlinked world and crushed by the print metaphor.\n- Late 2010s: Taking a website optimized for mobile use and offering it to desktop users results in a degraded user experience, as we have seen in this article.\n- 2020? Taking a mobile app and cramming it onto a [watch will also be terrible](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/smartwatch/). Let\u2019s hope that history won\u2019t repeat itself, though it surely will.\n\nTempting as it may be to design once and use twice, it can result in a subpar user experience for one of the platforms, and maybe for both of them. Providing content and feature parity across devices is a great goal, but it doesn\u2019t mean that all the UI elements and the design must also stay exactly the same. Each UI platform has different capabilities leading to different design requirements for an optimized user experience. Serving users on multiple platforms requires a multiplatform design strategy.\n\n### Other Articles Related to the NN/g Hidden-Navigation Study\n\n[Hamburger Menus and Hidden Navigation Hurt UX Metrics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/)\n\n[Hidden- and Visible-Navigation Study: Methodology](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hidden-navigation-methodology/)\n\n[How to Make Navigation (Even Hamburger) Discoverable on Mobile](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/find-navigation-mobile-even-hamburger/)\n\n[Beyond the Hamburger: How to Make Navigation Discoverable on Desktops](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/find-navigation-desktop-not-hamburger/)\n\nLearn more about scaling user interfaces across different devices in our full-day [course](https://www.nngroup.com/courses/scaling-responsive-design/).\n\n## Related Courses\n\n- [#### Mobile User Experience\n\n  Essential UX design principles for small-screen websites and apps\n\n  Interaction](/courses/usability-mobile-websites-apps/?lm=mobile-first-not-mobile-only&pt=article)\n- [#### Web Page UX Design\n\n  Strategically combine content, visuals, and interactive components to design successful web pages\n\n  Interaction](/courses/web-page-design/?lm=mobile-first-not-mobile-only&pt=article)\n- [#### The Human Mind and Usability\n\n  Use psychology to predict and explain how your customers think and act\n\n  Interaction](/courses/human-mind/?lm=mobile-first-not-mobile-only&pt=article)\n\nhamburger,mobile navigation,Mobile & Tablet,Navigation,Web Usability\n\n## Related Topics\n\n- Mobile & Tablet\n  [Mobile & Tablet](/topic/mobile-and-tablet-design/)\n- [Navigation](/topic/navigation/)\n- [Web Usability](/topic/web-usability/)\n\n## Learn More:\n\n- [![](https://media.nngroup.com/media/videos/thumbnails/Grids_101_Thumbnail.jpg.650x364_q75_autocrop_crop-smart_upscale.jpg)\n\n  Grids 101\n\n  Kelley Gordon\n  \u00b7\n  4 min](/videos/grids-101/?lm=mobile-first-not-mobile-only&pt=article)\n- [![](https://media.nngroup.com/media/videos/thumbnails/Hamburger_Menu_Icon_Update_Thumbnail.jpg.650x364_q75_autocrop_crop-smart_upscale.jpg)\n\n  Hamburger Menu Icon Update\n\n  Kate Kaplan\n  \u00b7\n  3 min](/videos/hamburger-menu-icon-update/?lm=mobile-first-not-mobile-only&pt=article)\n- [![](https://media.nngroup.com/media/videos/thumbnails/2-Factor_Authentication_2-FA_Thumbnail.jpg.650x364_q75_autocrop_crop-smart_upscale.jpg)\n\n  2-Factor Authentication (2-FA)\n\n  Tim Neusesser\n  \u00b7\n  4 min](/videos/2-factor-authentication/?lm=mobile-first-not-mobile-only&pt=article)\n\n## Related Articles:\n\n- [Hamburger Menus and Hidden Navigation Hurt UX Metrics\n\n  Kara Pernice and Raluca Budiu\n  \u00b7\n  12 min](/articles/hamburger-menus/?lm=mobile-first-not-mobile-only&pt=article)\n- [Supporting Mobile Navigation in Spite of a Hamburger Menu\n\n  Amy Schade\n  \u00b7\n  4 min](/articles/support-mobile-navigation/?lm=mobile-first-not-mobile-only&pt=article)\n- [List Thumbnails on Mobile: When to Use Them and Where to Place Them\n\n  Aurora Harley\n  \u00b7\n  4 min](/articles/mobile-list-thumbnail/?lm=mobile-first-not-mobile-only&pt=article)\n- [Basic Patterns for Mobile Navigation: A Primer\n\n  Raluca Budiu\n  \u00b7\n  7 min](/articles/mobile-navigation-patterns/?lm=mobile-first-not-mobile-only&pt=article)\n- [Don\u2019t Use Split Buttons for Navigation Menus\n\n  Raluca Budiu\n  \u00b7\n  9 min](/articles/split-buttons-navigation/?lm=mobile-first-not-mobile-only&pt=article)\n- [Visual Indicators to Differentiate Items in a List\n\n  Aurora Harley\n  \u00b7\n  6 min](/articles/visual-indicators-differentiators/?lm=mobile-first-not-mobile-only&pt=article)",
