They are called \"heuristics\" because they are broad rules of thumb and not specific usability guidelines.\nThank you to\nKelley Gordon\nfor designing the visuals and posters included in this article.\nThank you to\nKate Moran\nand\nFeifei Liu\nfor updating the heuristic names, descriptions, and examples.\nIn This Article:\n1: Visibility of System Status\n2: Match Between the System and the Real World\n3: User Control and Freedom\n4: Consistency and Standards\n5: Error Prevention\n6: Recognition Rather than Recall\n7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use\n8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design\n9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors\n10: Help and Documentation\nFree 10 Heuristics Poster\n1: Visibility of System Status\nThe design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time.\nWhen users know the current system status, they learn the outcome of their prior interactions and determine next steps. Predictable interactions create trust in the product as well as the brand.\nExample of Usability Heuristic #1:\nYou Are Here\nindicators on mall maps show people where they currently are, to help them understand where to go next.\nTips\nCommunicate clearly to users what the system\u2019s state is \u2014 no action with consequences to users should be taken without informing them.\nPresent feedback to the user as quickly as possible (ideally, immediately).\nBuild trust through open and\ncontinuous communication\n.\nLearn more\nFull article:\nVisibility of System Status\n3-minute video about the\nVisibility Heuristic\n2: Match Between the System and the Real World\nThe design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.\nThe way you should design depends very much on your specific users. Terms, concepts, icons, and images that seem perfectly clear to you and your colleagues may be unfamiliar or confusing to your users.\nWhen a design\u2019s controls follow real-world conventions and correspond to desired outcomes (called\nnatural mapping\n), it\u2019s easier for users to learn and remember how the interface works. This helps to build an experience that feels intuitive.\nExample of Usability Heuristic #2:\nWhen stovetop controls match the layout of heating elements, users can quickly understand which control maps to which heating element.\nTips\nEnsure that\u00a0users can understand meaning without having to go look up a word\u2019s definition.\nNever assume your understanding of words or concepts will match that\u00a0of your users.\nUser research will\u00a0uncover your\nusers' familiar terminology,\nas well as their mental models around important concepts.\nLearn more\nFull article:\nMatch Between the System and the Real World\n2-minute video:\nMatch Between the System and the Real World\n3: User Control and Freedom\nUsers often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked \"emergency exit\" to leave the unwanted action without having to go through an extended process.\nWhen it's easy for people to back out of a process or undo an action, it fosters a sense of freedom and confidence. Exits allow users to remain in control of the system and avoid getting stuck and feeling frustrated.\nExample of Usability Heuristic #3:\nDigital spaces need quick emergency exits, just like physical spaces do.\nTips\nSupport\nUndo\nand\nRedo\n.\nShow a clear way to exit the current interaction, like a\nCancel\nbutton\n.\nMake sure the exit is clearly labeled and discoverable.\nLearn more\nFull article:\nUser Control and Freedom\n2-minute video:\nUser Control and Freedom\n4: Consistency and Standards\nUsers should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry conventions.\nJakob's Law\nstates that people spend most of their time using digital products\nother than yours\n. Users\u2019 experiences with those other products set their expectations. Failing to maintain consistency may increase the users'\ncognitive load\nby forcing them to learn something new.\nExample of Usability Heuristic #4:\nCheckin counters are usually located at the front of hotels. This consistency meets customers\u2019 expectations.\nTips\nImprove\nlearnability\nby maintaining both types of consistency: internal and external.\nMaintain\nconsistency\nwithin a single product or a\nfamily of products (internal consistency).\nFollow established\nindustry conventions\n(external consistency).\nLearn more\nFull article:\nConsistency and Standards\n3-minute video:\nConsistency and Standards\n5: Error Prevention\nGood error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions, or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.\nThere are two types of errors:\nslips and mistakes\n. Slips are unconscious errors caused by inattention. Mistakes are conscious errors based on a mismatch between the user\u2019s mental model and the design.\nExample of Usability Heuristic #5:\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nGuard rails on curvy mountain roads prevent drivers from falling off cliffs.\nTips\nPrioritize your effort: Prevent high-cost errors first, then little frustrations.\nAvoid slips\nby providing helpful constraints and good\ndefaults\n.\nPrevent mistakes by removing memory burdens, supporting undo, and\nwarning your users\n.\nLearn more\nFull article:\nPreventing User Errors\n3-minute video:\nError Prevention\n6: Recognition Rather than Recall\nMinimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another. Information required to use the design (e.g. field labels or menu items) should be visible or easily retrievable when needed.\nHumans have limited short-term\nmemories\n. Interfaces that promote recognition reduce the amount of cognitive effort required from users.\nExample of Usability Heuristic #6:\nIt\u2019s easier for most people to recognize the capitals of countries, instead of having to remember them. People are more likely to correctly answer the question\nIs Lisbon the capital of Portugal?\nrather than\nWhat\u2019s the capital of Portugal?\nTips\nLet people recognize information in the interface, rather than forcing them to remember (\u201crecall\u201d) it.\nOffer\nhelp in context\n, instead of giving users a long tutorial to memorize.\nReduce the information that users have to remember.\nLearn more\nFull article:\nRecognition vs. Recall in UX\n3-minute video:\nRecognition vs. Recall\n7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use\nShortcuts \u2014 hidden from novice users \u2014 may speed up the interaction for the expert user so\u00a0that the design can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.\nFlexible processes can be carried out in different ways, so that people can pick whichever method works for them.\nExample of Usability Heuristic #7:\nRegular routes are listed on maps, but locals with knowledge of the area can take shortcuts.\nTips\nProvide\naccelerators\nlike keyboard shortcuts and touch gestures.\nProvide\npersonalization\nby tailoring content and functionality for individual users.\nAllow for\ncustomization\n, so users can make selections about how they want the product to work.\nLearn more\nFull article:\nFlexibility and Efficiency of Use: The 7th Usability Heuristic Explained\n3-minute video:\nFlexibility and Efficiency of Use\n8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design\nInterfaces should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.\nThis heuristic doesn't mean you have to use a\nflat design\n\u2014 it's about making sure you're keeping the content and visual design focused on the essentials. Ensure that the visual elements of the interface support the user's primary goals.\nExample of Usability Heuristic #8:\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nAn ornate teapot may have excessive decorative elements, like an uncomfortable handle or hard-to-wash nozzle, that can interfere with usability.\nTips\nKeep the\ncontent\nand\nvisual design\nof UI focused on the essentials.\nDon't let unnecessary elements distract users from the information they really need.\nPrioritize the content and features\nto support primary goals.\nLearn more\nFull article:\nAesthetic and Minimalist Design (Usability Heuristic #8)\n3-minute video:\nAesthetic and Minimalist Design\n9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors\nError messages should be expressed in plain language (no error codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.\nThese error messages should also be presented with visual treatments that will help users notice and recognize them.\nExample of Usability Heuristic #9:\nWrong way\nsigns on the road remind drivers that they are heading in the wrong direction and ask them to stop.\nTips\nUse traditional\nerror-message\nvisuals, like bold, red text.\nTell users what went wrong in\nlanguage they will understand\n\u2014 avoid technical jargon.\nOffer users a solution, like a shortcut that can solve the error immediately.\nLearn more\nFull article:\nError-Message Guidelines\n2-minute video:\nHelping Users Overcome Errors\n10: Help and Documentation\nIt\u2019s best if the system doesn\u2019t need any additional explanation. However, it may be necessary to provide documentation to help users understand how to complete their tasks.\nHelp and documentation content should be easy to search and focused on the user's task. Keep it concise, and list concrete steps that need to be carried out.\nExample of Usability Heuristic #10:\nInformation kiosks at airports are easily recognizable and solve customers\u2019 problems in context and immediately.\nTips\nEnsure that the help documentation is easy to\nsearch\n.\nWhenever possible, present the documentation in context right at the moment that the user requires it.\nList concrete steps to be carried out.\nLearn more\nFull article:\nHelp and Documentation: The 10th Usability Heuristic\n3-minute video:\nHelp and Documentation\nFree 10 Heuristics Poster\nDownload a\nfree summary poster\nor\n10 detailed posters\nof the 10 Usability Heuristics, designed by\nKelley Gordon\n,\nKate Moran\n, and\nFeifei Liu\n.\nDownload and print our\nfree usability heuristic posters\n. Hang them at home, in your office, or gift them to a colleague.\nNote from Jakob\nI originally developed the heuristics for heuristic evaluation in collaboration with Rolf Molich in 1990 [Molich and Nielsen 1990; Nielsen and Molich 1990]. Four years later, I refined the heuristics based on a factor analysis of 249 usability problems [Nielsen 1994a] to derive a set of heuristics with maximum explanatory power, resulting in this revised set of heuristics [Nielsen 1994b].\nIn 2020, we updated this article, adding more explanation, examples, and related links. While we slightly refined the language of the definitions, the\n10 heuristics themselves have remained relevant and unchanged since 1994.\nWhen something has remained true for 26 years, it will likely apply to future generations of user interfaces as well.\nSee Also\nExamples\n10 Usability Heuristics Applied to C\nomplex Applications\n\u2014 Examples of the heuristics applied to complex and domain-specific software applications.\n10 Usability Heuristics Applied to Virtual Reality\n\u2014 See the heuristics applied to 3D virtual environments.\n10 Usability Heuristics Applied to Video Games\n\u2014 Great examples of the 10 heuristics in highly interactive and highly visual user interfaces that have an entertainment purpose.\n10 Usability Heuristics Applied to Everyday Life\n(Just for fun)\nChecklists & Guidelines\nFull set of\n2,397 UX design guidelines\n(across multiple reports).\nBruce \"Tog\" Tognazzini's list of\nbasic principles for interface design\n.

Four years later, I refined the heuristics based on a factor analysis of 249 usability problems [Nielsen 1994a] to derive a set of heuristics with maximum explanatory power, resulting in this revised set of heuristics [Nielsen 1994b].\n\nIn 2020, we updated this article, adding more explanation, examples, and related links. While we slightly refined the language of the definitions, the **10 heuristics themselves have remained relevant and unchanged since 1994.** When something has remained true for 26 years, it will likely apply to future generations of user interfaces as well.\n\n### See Also\n\n#### **Examples**\n\n- **[10 Usability Heuristics Applied to C](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-heuristics-complex-applications/)**[**omplex Applications**](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-heuristics-complex-applications/)\u00a0\u2014 Examples of the heuristics applied to complex and domain-specific software applications.\n- **[10 Usability Heuristics Applied to Virtual Reality](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-heuristics-virtual-reality/)** \u2014 See the heuristics applied to 3D virtual environments.\n- [**10 Usability Heuristics Applied to Video Games**](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-heuristics-applied-video-games/) \u2014 Great examples of the 10 heuristics in highly interactive and highly visual user interfaces that have an entertainment purpose.\n- **[10 Usability Heuristics Applied to Everyday Life](http://www.zenhaiku.com/archives/usability_applied_to_life.html)**(Just for fun)\n\n#### **Checklists & Guidelines**\n\n- Full set of [2,397 UX design guidelines](https://www.nngroup.com/reports/) (across multiple reports).\n- Bruce \"Tog\" Tognazzini's list of [basic principles for interface design](https://asktog.com/atc/principles-of-interaction-design/). The list is slightly too long for heuristic evaluation but serves as a useful checklist.\n\n### **References**\n\nMolich, R., and Nielsen, J. (1990).
