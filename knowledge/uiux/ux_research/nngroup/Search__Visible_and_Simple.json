The best designs offer a simple search box on the homepage and play down advanced search and scoping.\nUsers love search for two reasons:\nSearch lets users\ncontrol their own destiny\nand assert independence from websites' attempt to direct how they use the web. Testing situations routinely validate this. A typical comment is: \"I don't want to have to navigate this site the way they want me to. I just want to find the thing I'm looking for.\" This is why many users go straight to the\nhomepage\nsearch function.\nSearch is also users'\nescape hatch when they are stuck\nin navigation. When they can't find a reasonable place to go next, they often turn to the site's search function. This is why you should make search\navailable from every page\non the site; you cannot predict where users will be when they decide they are lost.\nSearch is a big deal: the\nusability of the search on intranets\nwe have tested accounted for 43% of the difference in employee productivity between intranets with high and low usability.\n(Note that good search is not enough: in researching\nintranet information architecture\n, we found that the best designs offer mutually helpful integration between search and navigation.)\nIn This Article:\nSearch Should be a Box\nQuery Reformulation: Not\nAdvanced Search: Not\nScoped Search: Maybe\nFirst Results Page is Golden\nUpdates: 62 Design Guidelines for Search\nSearch Should be a Box\nUsers often move fast and furiously when they're looking for search. As we've seen in recent studies, they typically scan the homepage looking for\n\"the little box where I can type.\"\nWe've long known that\nusers scan\n, and the implications are clear:\nOn homepages, search should be a\ntype-in field and not a link\n.\nPut the search box at the\ntop of the page\n, usually in the right hand corner (though the left works almost as well).\nThe search input field should be\nwide enough\nto contain the typical query; if the box is too small, the query will scroll and diminish usability.\nWhen I changed the useit.com homepage to include a search box instead of a link,\nsearch engine use increased by 91%\n. Small change, big effect (as is\noften the outcome\nwhen implementing usability guidelines).\nInterior pages may use a search link if they have a very simple design; complex interior pages should use a search box.\n(See separate articles for advice on when to use the\nlabel \"Search\" and when to use \"Find\" or \"Retrieve\"\nand what to do about\nemployee directory search on intranets\n.)\nQuery Reformulation: Not\nGiven that search is becoming old hat on the internet, you might think users would develop advanced search skills. Not so.\nTypical users are very poor at query reformulation: If they don't get good results on the first try, later search attempts rarely succeed. In fact, they often give up. We recently studied a large group of people as they\nshopped on various ecommerce sites\n. Their search success rate was:\nSearch\nSuccess\nFirst query:\n51%\nSecond query:\n32%\nThird query:\n18%\nIn other words, if users don't find the result with their first query, they are progressively less and less likely to succeed with additional searches. Many users don't even bother: In our study,\nalmost half the users whose first search failed gave up immediately\n.\nThere is no question that we need to develop methods to help users hone their searches. Probably the only long-term solution is for the school systems to teach kids strategies for query reformulation. In the short term, search interfaces could show users easy ways to extend queries.\nRealistically, though, search design should assume that most users won't be willing or able to refine their queries. Given this, the emphasis should be on increasing users' success on the first attempt.\nAnother reason to emphasize early success is that users typically make very quick judgments about a website's value based on the quality of one or two sets of search results. If the list looks like junk, they may abandon the site completely. At a minimum, they'll forgo the site's search in favor of external search engines like Google.\nAdvanced Search: Not\nIn our recent search study, the\nmean query length was 2.0 words\n. Other studies also show a preponderance of simple searches.\nMost users cannot use advanced search or Boolean query syntax\n.\nThis has two implications for search design:\nEmphasize your search engine's ability to handle single-word queries\nand very short multi-word queries and still produce high-quality results.\nDo not offer advanced search\nfrom the homepage. Advanced search leads users into trouble, as they invariably use it wrong. When it makes sense, offer advanced search as an option users can link to from the search results page: \"Didn't find what you were looking for? Try advanced search.\"\nScoped Search: Maybe\nScoped search lets users limit the search to results from specific areas of the site (the search scope). In general,\nthis is dangerous\n. Users often overlook the scope, or they think they are in a different site area than the one they are actually searching.\nHowever, as websites continue to grow and offer multiple services in a single site, my attitude toward scoped search is changing. I now believe scoping can be sufficiently useful if you offer it in areas of the site that are both clearly delimitated and address specific problems.\nIf you choose to use scoped search, I recommend following a few basic rules:\nSet the default search scope to \"all\" (search the entire site).\nWhen the user chooses a narrow search scope, explicitly state the scope at the top of the results page.\nOffer one-click access to enlarge the scope. It is especially important to give users a highly visible way of searching the entire site if their scoped search fails to return any results.\nIf a search returns too many results, give users suggestions for limiting the scope.\nFirst Results Page is Golden\nUsers almost never look beyond the second page of search results. It is thus essential that your search prioritize results in a useful way and that all the most important hits appear on the first page.\nAlso, look through the most common queries in your search engine logs and determine the optimal landing page for each common query. You can then manually tweak the search engine to show these pages as the #1 hit.\nUpdates: 62 Design Guidelines for Search\nOur\nguidelines for search user experience\nare available for download.\nIn 2002, we\nscored 20 sites for the degree to which they followed best practices\nfor usable design, using a much earler version of this guidelines checklist. One positive finding was that\nsearch design has improved significantly\nin the year since this article was written, with the average site\nfollowing 48% of the usability guidelines\n. Of course it is not that great that websites follow slightly less than half of the usability principles for search, so we still have far to go before search reaches its full potential for helping web users.\nRelated Courses\nInformation Architecture\nOrganize and structure information to improve findability and discoverability\nInteraction\nSearch,ui elements\nRelated Topics\nSearch\nSearch\nLearn More:\nLove at First Sight in Eyetracking\nFeifei Liu\n\u00b7\n3 min\nHow to Design a Good Search UI\nKara Pernice\n\u00b7\n2 min\nThe Pinball Pattern of Scanning Search Results Pages\nKate Moran\n\u00b7\n2 min\nRelated Articles:\nSite Search Suggestions\nKate Moran\n\u00b7\n6 min\n7 Ways to Improve Your Website\u2019s or Intranet\u2019s Built-In Search Engine\nPage Laubheimer\n\u00b7\n8 min\nScoped Search: Dangerous, but Sometimes Useful\nKatie Sherwin\n\u00b7\n6 min\nThe Magnifying-Glass Icon in Search Design: Pros and Cons\nKatie Sherwin\n\u00b7\n6 min\n3 Guidelines for Search Engine \"No Results\" Pages\nKathryn Whitenton\n\u00b7\n5 min\nIncompetent Research Skills Curb Users' Problem Solving\nJakob Nielsen\n\u00b7\n5 min",
