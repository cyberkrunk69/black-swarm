These heuristics equally apply today as they did back then. Usability heuristic #9 emphasizes the importance of good error-message design: \"Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors.\" Effectively handling errors is crucial because it's one of the\n5 quality components of usable experiences.\nError message\n: A system-generated interruption to the user's workflow that informs the user of an incomplete, incompatible, or undesirable situation according to the system's implementation.\nQuality and error messages rarely go together, though. Product teams can be so focused on designing or engineering the idealistic user path that deviations from that path become a frustrating afterthought.\nIn This Article:\nVisibility Guidelines\nCommunication Guidelines\nEfficiency Guidelines\nMitigate Failure with Novelty in Dire Situations\nConclusion\nVisibility Guidelines\nError messages must present themselves noticeably and recognizably to users.\nDisplay the error message close to the error's source.\nReduce\ncognitive load\nby displaying an error indicator adjacent to the interface where the error occurred.\nProximity\nhelps users associate the error message content with the interface elements needing attention.\nBad: When the user adds an unrecognizable URL to their Instagram profile, the resulting error message is subtly styled and positioned far away from the URL field.\nUse noticeable, redundant, and accessible indicators.\nText and highlights that are bold, high-contrast, and red are conventional error-message visuals. Use this styling for the message and for the affected elements needing correction. Another technique for improving noticeability is leveraging\ncarefully designed animations\nto guide the user's visual attention for corrections. Remember\naccessibility guidelines\nto aid the roughly 350 million people worldwide with a color-vision deficiency, and never use exclusively color or animation to indicate errors.\nGood: Amazon utilizes several techniques to indicate an error: border highlighting, iconography, and red text.\nGood: CafePress displays an animated banner to attract the user\u2019s attention to the blank customization field.\nDesign errors based on their impact.\nDesign your error messages to indicate the problem's severity. For example, sometimes users only need to be warned of unexpected or potentially undesirable outcomes but can otherwise advance their workflow. Differentiate between these \"good to know\" messages from those posing a barrier to the user's progress. For example, conditionally displayed labels, toast notifications, or banners can be used for issues needing minimal user interaction, whereas\nmodal dialogs\nrequire the user's attention and resolution and should be reserved for severe errors.\nGood: Kohl\u2019s uses a message without conventional red formatting to notify users about potential shipping delays.\nAvoid prematurely displaying errors.\nTiming is a crucial aspect of designing effective error messages. Presenting errors too early is a\nhostile pattern\n. It\u2019s like grading a test before the student has had a chance to answer. It can make users feel annoyed, belittled, or confused. Don't assume that exploratory interactions (like the user moving text focus from a text box without filling it in) are errors. However, do consider inline, real-time errors for error-prone interactions where users are unlikely to enter the correct information on their first try. This immediate guidance reduces\ninteraction costs\nfor correction.\nGood: CLEAR provides clear, accessible indicators close to the text input about meeting specific password requirements, which could be a highly error-prone interaction.\nBad: This Texas vehicle-registration\u2013renewal page displays an error if the email text input loses focus while empty, which suggests the user did something wrong by merely exploring the interface.\nCommunication Guidelines\nError messages cannot rely on visuals alone. They must contain copy to elaborate and assist the user with recovering from the error.\nUse human-readable language.\nError messages should be plainspoken using\nlegible and readable text\n(many writing apps can give you feedback on a message's readability). Avoid technical jargon and use language familiar to your users instead. The Web's most common error message, the 404 page, violates this guideline. Hide or minimize the use of obscure error codes or abbreviations; show them for technical diagnostic purposes only.\nConcisely and precisely describe the issue.\nGeneric messages such as\nAn error occurred\nlack context. Provide descriptions of the exact problems to help users understand what happened. That said, beware of excessive technical precision and accuracy that can undermine understandability. The user's\nmental model\nof how the system works likely differs from the conceptual model of how it was coded.\nBad: When searching for dining locations with very narrow filters, Disneyworld obfuscates the lack of results with puns instead of clearly conveying the situation.\nOffer constructive advice.\nMerely stating the problem is also not enough; offer some potential remedies. One example is an\nOut of stock\nmessage for an ecommerce website. Include details of when the product will be available again or suggest that users sign up for a restock notification by entering their emails.\nTake a positive tone and don't blame the user.\nWrite with a positive and nonjudgmental\ntone of voice\n. Don't use\nphrasing that blames users or implies they are doing something wrong, such as\ninvalid\n,\nillegal\n, or\nincorrect\n. The proper usage of any system lies with its creators and not with the system's users, so the system must gracefully adapt and not shift blame. Avoid humor since it can become stale if users encounter the error frequently.\nGood: Target gives clear feedback that users must spend more to qualify for same-day shipping. Note how the message avoids blaming the user for not purchasing enough and focuses instead on the threshold.\nBad: The National Geographic Kids website does not explain itself if an underage user clicks on the shop. A better message would clarify that only adults can use the shop and that the user should ask for their help.\nEfficiency Guidelines\nGood errors go beyond just explaining but protect the user's effort and time. Offer\naccelerators\nto resolve the situation or share a bit of instruction to aid users' understanding and hopefully avoid the problem in the future.\nSafeguard against likely mistakes.\nThe very worst error messages are those that don't exist. When users make a mistake and receive no feedback, it can create a cascade of misunderstanding, wasted effort, and frustration. Years ago, email apps would dutifully send your email even though it referred to an attachment you forgot to include. Now, most apps will detect this situation and prompt you with an error message before sending it, thus sparing you embarrassment.\nGood: Email apps have evolved to detect and warn about common email mistakes, such as forgetting to include attachments.\nPreserve the user's input.\nLet users correct errors by editing their original action instead of starting over. For example, display the original text entered into a text field even if it does not match the requirements for that field and allow the user to modify it.\nGood: If the user navigates back while adding an image to an Instagram story, the system provides an option to save their work as a draft to avoid losing it.\nReduce error-correction effort.\nIf possible, guess the correct action and let users pick it from a small list of fixes. For example, instead of just saying\nCity and ZIP code don't match,\nlet users click on a button for the city that matches the ZIP code they entered.\nConcisely educate on how the system works\n. Explain to your users how the system works and how to resolve an error. If additional information is required, use hypertext\nlinks to connect a concise error message to a page with supplementary material or an explanation of the problem. (Don't overdo this, though.)\nGood: Vistaprint communicates what will happen to text placed outside the printable area for a custom shirt.\nBad: Although Zazzle displays guides for a shirt's printable area, it does not warn the user about the cut-off text, potentially resulting in designing and purchasing an undesired shirt.\nMitigate Failure with Novelty in Dire Situations\nThe above guidelines are essential and applicable to all error messages. That said, there is one last guideline to consider when the system becomes incapable of serving users in any functional capacity:\nMitigate total failure with novelty.\nErrors are\nunenjoyable for everyone involved\nas they interfere with user and business goals. Yet sometimes users may encounter an error so catastrophic (e.g., overloaded servers) there is no recourse but to wait or try again later. It's these specific moments (which should be rare and avoided at all costs) where blending an apology with something surprising or novel may salvage a disappointing situation that users will likely remember due to\nnegativity bias\nand the\npeak-end rule\n. Don't underestimate the challenge of communicating humility and delight \u2014 especially if user input is in jeopardy or the context has severe implications for users. Yet this tactic might enhance memorability and sustain user interest with low-stakes experiences until the system resumes functioning.\nGood: Generative AI experiences like ChatGPT can use downtime to entertain and teach users about its open-ended capabilities until the service is restored.\nGood: Although Twitter stopped using the \"Fail Whale\" (by artist Yiying Lu) to notify users of service disruptions, the image transcended its error-message status and became famous for its whimsical depiction of effort.\nConclusion\nInteractions between humans and computers are constantly evolving, but there will inevitably be mistakes, misunderstandings, and, thus, a need for error messages. Follow these guidelines to ease these frustrating moments and help the user accomplish their task efficiently and with renewed confidence.\nFree Downloads\nJakob's Usability Heuristic #9 Poster\n(PDF)\nJakob's Usability Heuristic #9 Poster, A4 Size\n(PDF)\nJakob's Usability Heuristic #9 Poster, Letter Size\n(PDF)\nRelated Courses\nUX Basic Training\nFoundational concepts that everyone should know\nInteraction\nApplication Design for Web and Desktop\nComponents, design patterns, workflows, and ways of interacting with complex data\nInteraction\nerrors,Heuristic Evaluation,Application Design\nRelated Topics\nHeuristic Evaluation\nHeuristic Evaluation\nApplication Design\nLearn More:\nEnable cookies\nto watch NN/g videos\nError Messages 101\nTim Neusesser\n\u00b7\n3 min\nCheck Error-Message Quality with a Scoring Rubric\nEvan Sunwall\n\u00b7\n4 min\nCreate Efficient Error Messages\nEvan Sunwall\n\u00b7\n4 min\nTime to Make Tech Work\nJakob Nielsen\n\u00b7\n3 min\nRelated Articles:\nHow to Conduct a Heuristic Evaluation\nKate Moran and  Kelley Gordon\n\u00b7\n6 min\n10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design\nJakob Nielsen\n\u00b7\n8 min\nEvaluate Interface Learnability with Cognitive Walkthroughs\nKim Flaherty\n\u00b7\n8 min\n10 Design Guidelines for Reporting Errors in Forms\nRachel Krause\n\u00b7\n6 min\nMemory Recognition and Recall in User Interfaces\nRaluca Budiu\n\u00b7\n8 min\nMatch Between the System and the Real World (Usability Heuristic #2)\nAnna Kaley\n\u00b7\n5 min",
