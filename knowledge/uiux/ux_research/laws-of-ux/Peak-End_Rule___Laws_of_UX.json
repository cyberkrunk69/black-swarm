Pay close attention to the most intense points and the final moments (the \u201cend\u201d) of the user journey.\n2. Identify the moments when your product is most helpful, valuable, or entertaining and design to delight the end user.\n3. Remember that people recall negative experiences more vividly than positive ones.\n\n## Examples\n\n![Mailchimp app](/peak-end-rule/mailchimp-high-five_hu8619ed7cc54551b74d0e02d6f60ba873_152518_1200x0_resize_box_2.png)\n\n### Mailchimp\n\nMailchimp understands this is an important moment, especially for first-time users, so it goes beyond presenting a simple confirmation modal.
