Minimize choices when response times are critical to decrease decision time.\n2. Break complex tasks into smaller steps in order to decrease cognitive load.\n3. Avoid overwhelming users by highlighting recommended options.\n4. Use progressive onboarding to minimize cognitive load for new users.\n5. Be careful not to simplify to the point of abstraction.\n\n## Examples\n\n![Google Homepage](/hicks-law/google_hu45c738704ad4641ec8712ca42465ea32_141819_1200x0_resize_q75_box.jpg)\n\n### Google Homepage\n\nGoogle keeps the decisions required to enter a keyword to a minimum by eliminating any additional content that could distract from the act of typing a keyword or require additional decision-making.\n\n![Apple TV remote](/hicks-law/apple-remote_hu919c0cdadef6cb13ce52c21c3a56bfb5_1294405_1200x0_resize_q75_box.jpg)\n\n### Apple TV Remote\n\nApple TV remotes don\u2019t require a substantial amount of working memory and therefore incurs much less cognitive load.
