She discovered the Zeigarnik effect and contributed to the establishment of experimental psychopathology as a separate discipline in the Soviet Union in the post-World War II period. In the 1920s she conducted a study on memory, in which she compared memory in relation to incomplete and complete tasks. She had found that incomplete tasks are easier to remember than successful ones. This is now known as the Zeigarnik effect. She later began working at the Institute of Higher Nervous Activity which is where she would meet her next big influence Vygowsky, and become a part of his circle of scientists. It was also there that Zeigarnik founded the Department of Psychology. During that time, Zeigarnik received the Lewin Memorial Award in 1983 for her psychological research.\nSource\nFurther Reading\nHow to Use the Zeigarnik Effect in UX\nFeifei Liu | Nielsen Norman Group\nEndowed progress effect: Give your users a head start\nCanvs Editorial | UX Collective\nMoving the Finish Line: The Goal Gradient Hypothesis\nFarnam Street\nThe Zeigarnik Effect: Why it is so hard to leave things incomplete\nAbhishek Chakraborty | Medium.com\nZeigarnik Effect\nCoglode\nZeigarnik Effect on Wikipedia\nWikipedia\nBuy Large Format Poster\nDownload free poster\nRelated\nChunking\nA process by which individual pieces of an information set are broken down and then grouped together in a meaningful whole.\nCognitive Bias\nA systematic error of thinking or rationality in judgment that influence our perception of the world and our decision-making ability.\nCognitive Load\nThe amount of mental resources needed to understand and interact with an interface.",
