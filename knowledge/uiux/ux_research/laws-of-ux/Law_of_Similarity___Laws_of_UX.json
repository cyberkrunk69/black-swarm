Elements that are visually similar will be perceived as related.\n2. Color, shape, and size, orientation and movement can signal that elements belong to the same group and likely share a common meaning or functionality.\n3. Ensure that links and navigation systems are visually differentiated from normal text elements.\n\n## Origins\n\nThe principles of grouping (or Gestalt laws of grouping) are a set of principles in psychology, first proposed by Gestalt psychologists to account for the observation that humans naturally perceive objects as organized patterns and objects, a principle known as Pr\u00e4gnanz.
