Group functions of a similar nature so they are visually connected via colors, lines, frames, or other shapes.\n2. Alternately, you can use a tangible connecting reference (line, arrow, etc) from one element to the next to also create a visual connection.\n3. Use uniform connectedness to show context or to emphasize the relationship between similar items.\n\n## Examples\n\n![Google search results page](/law-of-uniform-connectedness/results_hudaa351b0abd164d601eefd2af4baa29f_642013_1200x0_resize_q75_box.jpg)\n\n### Google Search Results\n\nThe Law of Uniform Connectedness can be seen within Google\u2019s search results with borders that surrounds specific items such as videos and \u2018featured snippets\u2019.
