This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.\n\n## Takeaways\n\n1. Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that appears similar.\n2. By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the users can focus on their tasks rather than on learning new models.\n3. When making changes, minimize discord by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited time.\n\n## Examples\n\n![Analog vs digital controls](/jakobs-law/controls_hu6f37321e6a2935d218a19d650be04ffb_810470_1200x0_resize_q75_box.jpg)\n\n### Form Controls\n\nThings like form toggles, radio inputs, and even buttons originated from the design of their tactile counterparts.\n\n![YouTube before and after 2017 redesign](/jakobs-law/youtube_hufe57137c97096f36348632c7859da15d_805439_1200x0_resize_q75_box.jpg)\n\n### YouTube Redesign\n\nWhen YouTube launched a new version in 2017 after years of essentially the same design, they allowed desktop users to ease into the new Material Design UI without having to commit.
