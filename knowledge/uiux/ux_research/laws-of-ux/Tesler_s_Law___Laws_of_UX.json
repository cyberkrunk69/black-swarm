All processes have a core of complexity that cannot be designed away and therefore must be assumed by either the system or the user.\n2. Ensure as much as possible of the burden is lifted from users by dealing with inherent complexity during design and development.\n3. Remember to not build products and services for an idealized, rational user, because people don\u2019t always behave rationally in real life.\n4. Make guidance accessible and fit within the context of use so that it can help these active new users, no matter what path they choose to take (e.g., tooltips with helpful information).\n\n## Origins\n\nWhile working for Xerox PARC in the mid-1980s, Larry Tesler realized that the way users interact with applications was just as important as the application itself.
