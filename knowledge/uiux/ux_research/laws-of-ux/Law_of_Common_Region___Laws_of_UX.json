Common region creates a clear structure and helps users quickly and effectively understand the relationship between elements and sections.\n2. Adding a border around an element or group of elements is an easy way to create common region.\n3. Common region can also be created by defining a background behind an element or group of elements.\n\n## Origins\n\nThe principles of grouping (or Gestalt laws of grouping) are a set of principles in psychology, first proposed by Gestalt psychologists to account for the observation that humans naturally perceive objects as organized patterns and objects, a principle known as Pr\u00e4gnanz. Gestalt psychologists argued that these principles exist because the mind has an innate disposition to perceive patterns in the stimulus based on certain rules.
