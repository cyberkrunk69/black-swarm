Be empathetic to, flexible about, and tolerant of any of the various actions the user could take or any input they might provide.\n2. Anticipate virtually anything in terms of input, access, and capability while providing a reliable and accessible interface.\n3. The more we can anticipate and plan for in design, the more resilient the design will be.\n4.
