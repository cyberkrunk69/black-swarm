Make important information or key actions visually distinctive.\n2. Use restraint when placing emphasis on visual elements to avoid them competing with one another and to ensure salient items don\u2019t get mistakenly identified as ads.\n3. Don\u2019t exclude those with a color vision deficiency or low vision by relying exclusively on color to communicate contrast.\n4. Carefully consider users with motion sensitivity when using motion to communicate contrast.\n\n## Origins\n\nThe theory was coined by German psychiatrist and pediatrician Hedwig von Restorff (1906\u20131962), who, in her 1933 study, found that when participants were presented with a list of categorically similar items with one distinctive, isolated item on the list, memory for the item was improved.\n\n[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Restorff_effect)\n\n## Further Reading\n\n### [Psychology in Design (Part 1)](https://blog.prototypr.io/psychology-in-design-part-1-cdc63229cbe4)\n\nAndri Budzinskiy | Medium.com\n\n### [The Psychology Principles Every UI/UX Designer Needs to Know](https://blog.marvelapp.com/psychology-principles-every-uiux-designer-needs-know/)\n\nThanasis Rigopoulos | Marvel\n\n### [Von Restorff Effect on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Restorff_effect)\n\nWikipedia\n\n### [Superior pattern processing is the essence of the evolved human brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4141622/)\n\nMark P.
