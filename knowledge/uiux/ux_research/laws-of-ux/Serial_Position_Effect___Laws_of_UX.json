Placing the least important items in the middle of lists can be helpful because these items tend to be stored less frequently in long-term and working memory.\n2. Positioning key actions on the far left and right within elements such as navigation can increase memorization.\n\n## Origins\n\nThe serial position effect, a term coined by Herman Ebbinghaus, describes how the position of an item in a sequence affects recall accuracy.
