An aesthetically pleasing design creates a positive response in people\u2019s brains and leads them to believe the design actually works better.\n2. People are more tolerant of minor usability issues when the design of a product or service is aesthetically pleasing.\n3. Visually pleasing design can mask usability problems and prevent issues from being discovered during usability testing.\n\n## Origins\n\nThe aesthetic-usability effect was first studied in the field of human\u2013computer interaction in 1995.
