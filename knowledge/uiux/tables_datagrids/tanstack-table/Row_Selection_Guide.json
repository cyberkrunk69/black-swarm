Check out these examples:\nReact row-selection\nVue row-selection\nReact expanding\nAPI\nRow Selection API\nRow Selection Guide\nThe row selection feature keeps track of which rows are selected and allows you to toggle the selection of rows in a myriad of ways. Let's take a look at some common use cases.\nAccess Row Selection State\nThe table instance already manages the row selection state for you (though as seen down below, it may be more convenient to manage the row selection state in your own scope). You can access the internal row selection state or the selected rows from a few APIs.\ngetState().rowSelection\n- returns the internal row selection state\ngetSelectedRowModel()\n- returns selected rows\ngetFilteredSelectedRowModel()\n- returns selected rows after filtering\ngetGroupedSelectedRowModel()\n- returns selected rows after grouping and sorting\nts\nconsole.log(table.getState().rowSelection) //get the row selection state - { 1: true, 2: false, etc... }\nconsole.log(table.getSelectedRowModel().rows) //get full client-side selected rows\nconsole.log(table.getFilteredSelectedRowModel().rows) //get filtered client-side selected rows\nconsole.log(table.getGroupedSelectedRowModel().rows) //get grouped client-side selected rows\nNote: If you are using\nmanualPagination\n, be aware that the\ngetSelectedRowModel\nAPI will only return selected rows on the current page because table row models can only generate rows based on the\ndata\nthat is passed in. Row selection state, however, can contain row ids that are not present in the\ndata\narray just fine.\nManage Row Selection State\nEven though the table instance will already manage the row selection state for you, it is usually more convenient to manage the state yourself in order to have easy access to the selected row ids that you can use to make API calls or other actions.\nUse the\nonRowSelectionChange\ntable option to hoist up the row selection state to your own scope. Then pass the row selection state back to the table instance using in the\nstate\ntable option.\nts\nconst [rowSelection, setRowSelection] = useState<RowSelectionState>({}) //manage your own row selection state\n\nconst table = useReactTable({\n  //...\n  onRowSelectionChange: setRowSelection, //hoist up the row selection state to your own scope\n  state: {\n    rowSelection, //pass the row selection state back to the table instance\n  },\n})\nUseful Row Ids\nBy default, the row id for each row is simply the\nrow.index\n. If you are using row selection features, you most likely want to use a more useful row identifier, since the row selection state is keyed by row id. You can use the\ngetRowId\ntable option to specify a function that returns a unique row id for each row.\nts\nconst table = useReactTable({\n  //...\n  getRowId: row => row.uuid, //use the row's uuid from your database as the row id\n})\nNow as rows are selected, the row selection state will look something like this:\njson\n{\n  \"13e79140-62a8-4f9c-b087-5da737903b76\": true,\n  \"f3e2a5c0-5b7a-4d8a-9a5c-9c9b8a8e5f7e\": false\n  //...\n}\ninstead of this:\njson\n{\n  \"0\": true,\n  \"1\": false\n  //...\n}\nEnable Row Selection Conditionally\nRow selection is enabled by default for all rows. To either enable row selection conditionally for certain rows or disable row selection for all rows, you can use the\nenableRowSelection\ntable option which accepts either a boolean or a function for more granular control.\nts\nconst table = useReactTable({\n  //...\n  enableRowSelection: row => row.original.age > 18, //only enable row selection for adults\n})\nTo enforce whether a row is selectable or not in your UI, you can use the\nrow.getCanSelect()\nAPI for your checkboxes or other selection UI.\nSingle Row Selection\nBy default, the table allows multiple rows to be selected at once. If, however, you only want to allow a single row to be selected at once, you can set the\nenableMultiRowSelection\ntable option to\nfalse\nto disable multi-row selection, or pass in a function to disable multi-row selection conditionally for a row's sub-rows.\nThis is useful for making tables that have radio buttons instead of checkboxes.\nts\nconst table = useReactTable({\n  //...\n  enableMultiRowSelection: false, //only allow a single row to be selected at once\n  // enableMultiRowSelection: row => row.original.age > 18, //only allow a single row to be selected at once for adults\n})\nSub-Row Selection\nBy default, selecting a parent row will select all of its sub-rows. If you want to disable auto sub-row selection, you can set the\nenableSubRowSelection\ntable option to\nfalse\nto disable sub-row selection, or pass in a function to disable sub-row selection conditionally for a row's sub-rows.\nts\nconst table = useReactTable({\n  //...\n  enableSubRowSelection: false, //disable sub-row selection\n  // enableSubRowSelection: row => row.original.age > 18, //disable sub-row selection for adults\n})\nRender Row Selection UI\nTanStack table does not dictate how you should render your row selection UI. You can use checkboxes, radio buttons, or simply hook up click events to the row itself. The table instance provides a few APIs to help you render your row selection UI.\nConnect Row Selection APIs to Checkbox Inputs\nTanStack Table provides some handler functions that you can connect directly to your checkbox inputs to make it easy to toggle row selection. These function automatically call other internal APIs to update the row selection state and re-render the table.\nUse the\nrow.getToggleSelectedHandler()\nAPI to connect to your checkbox inputs to toggle the selection of a row.\nUse the\ntable.getToggleAllRowsSelectedHandler()\nor\ntable.getToggleAllPageRowsSelectedHandler\nAPIs to connect to your \"select all\" checkbox input to toggle the selection of all rows.\nIf you need more granular control over these function handlers, you can always just use the\nrow.toggleSelected()\nor\ntable.toggleAllRowsSelected()\nAPIs directly. Or you can even just call the\ntable.setRowSelection()\nAPI to directly set the row selection state just as you would with any other state updater. These handler functions are just a convenience.\ntsx\nconst columns = [\n  {\n    id: 'select-col',\n    header: ({ table }) => (\n      <Checkbox\n        checked={table.getIsAllRowsSelected()}\n        indeterminate={table.getIsSomeRowsSelected()}\n        onChange={table.getToggleAllRowsSelectedHandler()} //or getToggleAllPageRowsSelectedHandler\n      />\n    ),\n    cell: ({ row }) => (\n      <Checkbox\n        checked={row.getIsSelected()}\n        disabled={!row.getCanSelect()}\n        onChange={row.getToggleSelectedHandler()}\n      />\n    ),\n  },\n  //... more column definitions...\n]\nConnect Row Selection APIs to UI\nIf you want a simpler row selection UI, you can just hook up click events to the row itself. The\nrow.getToggleSelectedHandler()\nAPI is also useful for this use case.\ntsx\n<tbody>\n  {table.getRowModel().rows.map(row => {\n    return (\n      <tr\n        key={row.id}\n        className={row.getIsSelected() ? 'selected' : null}\n        onClick={row.getToggleSelectedHandler()}\n      >\n        {row.getVisibleCells().map(cell => {\n          return <td key={cell.id}>{/* */}</td>\n        })}\n      </tr>\n    )\n  })}\n</tbody>",
