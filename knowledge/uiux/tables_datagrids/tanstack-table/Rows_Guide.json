This is discussed in much more detail in the\nRow Models Guide\n, but here are the most common ways you may access the row models.\nRender Rows\njsx\n<tbody>\n  {table.getRowModel().rows.map(row => (\n    <tr key={row.id}>\n     {/* ... */}\n    </tr>\n  ))}\n</tbody>\nGet Selected Rows\njs\nconst selectedRows = table.getSelectedRowModel().rows\nRow Objects\nEvery row object contains row data and many APIs to either interact with the table state or extract cells from the row based on the state of the table.\nRow IDs\nEvery row object has an\nid\nproperty that makes it unique within the table instance. By default the\nrow.id\nis the same as the\nrow.index\nthat is created in the row model. However, it can be useful to override each row's\nid\nwith a unique identifier from the row's data. You can use the\ngetRowId\ntable option to do this.\njs\nconst table = useReactTable({\n  columns,\n  data,\n  getRowId: originalRow => originalRow.uuid, //override the row.id with the uuid from the original row's data\n})\nNote: In some features like grouping and expanding, the\nrow.id\nwill have additional string appended to it.\nAccess Row Values\nThe recommended way to access data values from a row is to use either the\nrow.getValue\nor\nrow.renderValue\nAPIs. Using either of these APIs will cache the results of the accessor functions and keep rendering efficient. The only difference between the two is that\nrow.renderValue\nwill return either the value or the\nrenderFallbackValue\nif the value is undefined, whereas\nrow.getValue\nwill return the value or\nundefined\nif the value is undefined.\njs\n// Access data from any of the columns\nconst firstName = row.getValue('firstName') // read the row value from the firstName column\nconst renderedLastName = row.renderValue('lastName') // render the value from the lastName column\nNote:\ncell.getValue\nand\ncell.renderValue\nare shortcuts for the\nrow.getValue\nand\nrow.renderValue\nAPIs, respectively.\nAccess Original Row Data\nFor every row object, you can access the original corresponding\ndata\nthat was passed to the table instance via the\nrow.original\nproperty. None of the data in the\nrow.original\nwill have been modified by the accessors in your column definitions, so if you were doing any sort of data transformations in your accessors, those will not be reflected in the\nrow.original\nobject.\njs\n// Access any data from the original row\nconst firstName = row.original.firstName // { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe' }\nSub Rows\nIf you are using either grouping or expanding features, your rows may contain sub-rows or parent row references. This is discussed in much more detail in the\nExpanding Guide\n, but here is a quick overview of useful properties and methods for working with sub-rows.\nrow.subRows\n: An array of sub-rows for the row.\nrow.depth\n: The depth of the row (if nested or grouped) relative to the root row array. 0 for root level rows, 1 for child rows, 2 for grandchild rows, etc.\nrow.parentId\n: The unique ID of the parent row for the row (The row that contains this row in its subRows array).\nrow.getParentRow\n: Returns the parent row for the row, if it exists.\nMore Row APIs\nDepending on the features that you are using for your table, there are dozens more useful APIs for interacting with rows. See each features' respective API docs or guide for more information.",

This is discussed in much more detail in the [Row Models Guide](/table/latest/docs/guide/row-models), but here are the most common ways you may access the row models.\n\n[##### Render Rows](#render-rows)\n\njsx\n\n```\n<tbody>\n  {table.getRowModel().rows.map(row => (\n    <tr key={row.id}>\n     {/* ... */}\n    </tr>\n  ))}\n</tbody>\n```\n\n[##### Get Selected Rows](#get-selected-rows)\n\njs\n\n```\nconst selectedRows = table.getSelectedRowModel().rows\n```\n\n[### Row Objects](#row-objects)\n\nEvery row object contains row data and many APIs to either interact with the table state or extract cells from the row based on the state of the table.\n\n[#### Row IDs](#row-ids)\n\nEvery row object has an id property that makes it unique within the table instance. By default the row.id is the same as the row.index that is created in the row model. However, it can be useful to override each row's id with a unique identifier from the row's data. You can use the getRowId table option to do this.\n\njs\n\n```\nconst table = useReactTable({\n  columns,\n  data,\n  getRowId: originalRow => originalRow.uuid, //override the row.id with the uuid from the original row's data\n})\n```\n\n> Note: In some features like grouping and expanding, the row.id will have additional string appended to it.\n\n[#### Access Row Values](#access-row-values)\n\nThe recommended way to access data values from a row is to use either the row.getValue or row.renderValue APIs. Using either of these APIs will cache the results of the accessor functions and keep rendering efficient. The only difference between the two is that row.renderValue will return either the value or the renderFallbackValue if the value is undefined, whereas row.getValue will return the value or undefined if the value is undefined.\n\njs\n\n```\n// Access data from any of the columns\nconst firstName = row.getValue('firstName') // read the row value from the firstName column\nconst renderedLastName = row.renderValue('lastName') // render the value from the lastName column\n```\n\n> Note: cell.getValue and cell.renderValue are shortcuts for the row.getValue and row.renderValue APIs, respectively.\n\n[#### Access Original Row Data](#access-original-row-data)\n\nFor every row object, you can access the original corresponding data that was passed to the table instance via the row.original property. None of the data in the row.original will have been modified by the accessors in your column definitions, so if you were doing any sort of data transformations in your accessors, those will not be reflected in the row.original object.\n\njs\n\n```\n// Access any data from the original row\nconst firstName = row.original.firstName // { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe' }\n```\n\n[### Sub Rows](#sub-rows)\n\nIf you are using either grouping or expanding features, your rows may contain sub-rows or parent row references. This is discussed in much more detail in the [Expanding Guide](/table/latest/docs/guide/expanding), but here is a quick overview of useful properties and methods for working with sub-rows.\n\n- row.subRows: An array of sub-rows for the row.\n- row.depth: The depth of the row (if nested or grouped) relative to the root row array. 0 for root level rows, 1 for child rows, 2 for grandchild rows, etc.\n- row.parentId: The unique ID of the parent row for the row (The row that contains this row in its subRows array).\n- row.getParentRow: Returns the parent row for the row, if it exists.\n\n[### More Row APIs](#more-row-apis)\n\nDepending on the features that you are using for your table, there are dozens more useful APIs for interacting with rows.
