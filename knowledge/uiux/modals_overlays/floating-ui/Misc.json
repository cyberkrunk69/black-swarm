  "content_markdown": "# Misc\n\nInformation, tips, and guidelines to help you use Floating UI.\n\n## [Browser support](#browser-support)\n\nThe following browsers are supported (defined by `browserslist`):\n\n- Chrome >= 73\n- Firefox >= 78\n- Edge >= 79\n- Safari >= 12.0\n- iOS >= 12.0\n- Opera >= 53\n\n## [Keeping Floating UI up to date](#keeping-floating-ui-up-to-date)\n\nFloating UI uses internal first-party dependencies (under the\n`@floating-ui` org) that may be out of date, but contain bug\nfixes you may need. You may also be using Floating UI itself as a\ntransitive package of a different library.\n\nOnly certain packages are kept to the latest versions to avoid\nbumping dependant packages too frequently and to ensure wider\nversion support.\n\nTo upgrade Floating UI as a transitive package, install the\nnecessary packages directly, which will update your lockfile,\nthen uninstall them again so they aren\u2019t in your\n`package.json#dependencies`.\n\nFor all packages, `@floating-ui/core` should be updated manually:\n\n```\nnpm install @floating-ui/core@latest\nnpm uninstall @floating-ui/core\n```\n\nFor `@floating-ui/react`, `@floating-ui/react-dom`, or\n`@floating-ui/vue`, `@floating-ui/dom` should also be updated\nmanually:\n\n```\nnpm install @floating-ui/dom@latest\nnpm uninstall @floating-ui/dom\n```\n\nIf you\u2019re using a different library which wraps Floating UI, you\ncan also do the same for the relevant package it is depending on.\n\n## [Subpixel and accelerated positioning](#subpixel-and-accelerated-positioning)\n\nInstead of `top` and `left` as shown throughout the\ndocs, you can use transform styles instead to position the\nfloating element for increased performance.\n\n```\nfunction roundByDPR(value) {\n  const dpr = window.devicePixelRatio || 1;\n  return Math.round(value * dpr) / dpr;\n}\n \nObject.assign(floatingEl.style, {\n  top: '0',\n  left: '0',\n  transform: `translate(${roundByDPR(x)}px,${roundByDPR(y)}px)`,\n});\n```\n\n`x` and `y` can contain fractional numbers (decimal), so there\nwill be blurring unless we place it evenly on the device\u2019s pixel\ngrid. The rounding method above ensures the floating element is\npositioned optimally for the screen.\n\n### [3D transforms](#3d-transforms)\n\nYou can also promote the floating element to its own layer:\n\n```\nObject.assign(floatingEl.style, {\n  top: '0',\n  left: '0',\n  transform: `translate3d(${roundByDPR(x)}px,${roundByDPR(y)}px,0)`,\n});\n```\n\nIf you\u2019re animating the location of the floating element, using\n`transform` will offer smoother animations.\n\n## [z-index stacking](#z-index-stacking)\n\nFloating UI does not have opinions about how your elements stack\non the z-axis. This means your element may be occluded beneath\nanother positioned element if it has a higher `z-index`.\n\nDue to the complexity of this, it is up to you to handle the z\nindices of various floating elements in your application.\n\nIn the future, Floating UI may\n[enable you to specify elements to avoid](https://github.com/floating-ui/floating-ui/issues/1440),\nso multiple floating elements can avoid colliding with each other\nintelligently without worrying about their `z-index`.\n\n## [Clipping](#clipping)\n\nYour floating element may get clipped by an ancestor if it has\n`position: relative` and `overflow: hidden` CSS\nstyles, and small enough that the floating element cannot be\npositioned in view properly.\n\nTwo solutions include:\n\n- **Portalling**: The floating element can be appended to a\n  container outside of the clipping ancestor.\n- **Use fixed strategy**: Using the `'fixed'` strategy will\n  \u201cbreak\u201d the floating element out of its parent clipping context\n  in the majority of cases. This allows you to keep the floating\n  element\u2019s DOM context in tact. This is not 100% guaranteed\n  though \u2014 portalling is the only 100% reliable method.\n\n## [Handling large content](#handling-large-content)\n\nWhen your floating element\u2019s width exceeds the viewport\u2019s, it can\nresult in unexpected behavior.\n\nYou can limit the width of the floating element using the\nfollowing CSS:\n\n```\n.floating {\n  max-width: calc(100vw - 10px);\n}\n```\n\nThis will always make it 10 pixels less than the width of the\nviewport.\n\nThe constant `10` shown in the example should be double the\n`padding` given to the `shift()` middleware if it\u2019s\nin use.\n\nAlternatively, you may experiment with the [`size`](/docs/size)\nmiddleware depending on the axis overflow is occurring.\n\n## [Relative units](#relative-units)\n\nFloating UI works entirely with pixel units as it is a JavaScript\nlibrary that works with `getBoundingClientRect()` and other\nmeasurement properties that return pixels. Further, it is\ncross-platform, and pixels are the most commonly supported unit.\n\nIf your CSS uses relative units like `rem`, it is recommended you\nconvert the values into pixels before passing them to Floating\nUI.\n\n```\ncomputePosition(reference, floating, {\n  // 1rem => 16px\n  middleware: [offset(remToPx(1))],\n});\n```",
