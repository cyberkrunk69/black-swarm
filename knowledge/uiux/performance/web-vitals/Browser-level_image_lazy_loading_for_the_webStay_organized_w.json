Here's a\ndemo\nof the feature:\nLazy-loaded images load as the user scrolls through the page.\nThis page walks through the details of implementing lazy-loading in the browser.\nWhy browser-level lazy loading?\nAccording to the\nHTTP Archive\n,\nimages are the most-requested asset type for most websites, and they usually\ntake up more bandwidth than any other resource. At the 90th percentile, sites\nsend over 5 MB of images on desktop and mobile.\nPreviously, there were two ways to defer the loading of off-screen images:\nUsing the\nIntersection Observer API\nUsing\nscroll\n,\nresize\n, or\norientationchange\nevent handlers\nEither option can let developers include lazy loading behavior, and many\ndevelopers have built third-party libraries to provide abstractions that are\neven easier to use.\nWith lazy loading supported directly by the browser, however, there's no need for an external library. Browser-level lazy loading also ensures that loading of images still works even if the client disables JavaScript. Note however that loading is only deferred when JavaScript is enabled.\nThe\nloading\nattribute\nChrome loads images at different priorities depending on where they're located\nrelative to the device viewport. Images below the viewport are loaded with a\nlower priority, but they're still fetched as the page loads.\nYou can use the\nloading\nattribute to completely defer the loading of offscreen\nimages:\n<img src=\"image.png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\u2026\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\">\nHere are the supported values for the\nloading\nattribute:\nlazy\n: Defer loading of the resource until it reaches a\ncalculated distance\nfrom the viewport.\neager\n: Default loading behavior of the browser, which is the same as not\nincluding the attribute and means the image is loaded regardless of where it's\nlocated on the page. This is the default, but it can be useful to set\nexplicitly if your tooling automatically adds\nloading=\"lazy\"\nwhen there's no\nexplicit value, or if your linter complains if it isn't explicitly set.\nRelationship between the\nloading\nattribute and fetch priority\nThe\neager\nvalue is an instruction to load the image as usual, without delaying\nthe load further if the image is off-screen. It doesn't load the image faster\nthan another image that doesn't have a\nloading\nattribute.\nIf you want to increase the fetch priority of an important image (for example,\nthe LCP image), use\nFetch Priority\nwith\nfetchpriority=\"high\"\n.\nAn image with\nloading=\"lazy\"\nand\nfetchpriority=\"high\"\nis still delayed while\nit's off-screen, and then fetched with a high priority when it's almost within\nthe viewport. This combination isn't really necessary because the browser would\nlikely load that image with high priority anyway.\nDistance-from-viewport thresholds\nAll images that are immediately viewable without scrolling load normally. Images\nfar below the device viewport are only fetched when the user scrolls near them.\nChromium's implementation of lazy loading tries to ensure that offscreen images\nare loaded early enough that they finish loading by the time the user scrolls\nto them by fetching them well before they become visible in the viewport.\nThe distance threshold varies depending on the following factors:\nThe type of image resource being fetched\nThe\neffective connection type\nYou can find the default values for the different effective connection types in\nthe\nChromium source\n.\nYou can experiment with these different thresholds by\nthrottling the network\nin DevTools.\nImproved data-savings and distance-from-viewport thresholds\nIn July 2020, Chrome made significant improvements to align the image lazy loading distance-from-viewport thresholds to better meet developer expectations.\nOn fast connections (4G), we reduced Chrome's distance-from-viewport thresholds from\n3000px\nto\n1250px\nand on slower connections (3G or lower), changed the threshold from\n4000px\nto\n2500px\n. This change achieves two things:\n<img loading=lazy>\nbehaves closer to the experience offered by JavaScript lazy loading libraries.\nThe new distance-from-viewport thresholds still means images will probably have loaded by the time a user has scrolled to them.\nYou can find a comparison between the old versus new distance-from-viewport thresholds for one of our demos on a fast connection (4G) next:\nComparison of the older versus newer thresholds used for browser-level lazy-loading.\nand the new thresholds versus LazySizes (a popular JavaScript lazy loading library):\nComparison of the thresholds used for lazy-loading in Chrome and LazySizes.\nGive your images dimension attributes\nWhile the browser loads an image, it doesn't immediately know the image's\ndimensions, unless they're explicitly specified. To let the browser reserve\nenough space on a page for images, and avoid disruptive\nlayout shifts\n,\nwe recommend adding\nwidth\nand\nheight\nattributes to all\n<img>\ntags.\n<img src=\"image.png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\u2026\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\">\nAlternatively, specify their values directly in an inline style:\n<img src=\"image.png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\u2026\" style=\"height:200px; width:200px;\">\nThe best practice of setting dimensions applies to\n<img>\ntags regardless of\nwhether you're lazy loading them, but lazy loading can make it more important.\nLazy loading in Chromium is implemented in a way that makes images more likely\nto be loaded as soon as they're visible, but there's still a chance that\nthey won't load at the right time. If that happens, not specifying\nwidth\nand\nheight\non your images increases their impact on Cumulative Layout Shift. If\nyou can't specify your images' dimensions, lazy loading them can save network\nresources at the risk of these increased\nlayout shifts\n.\nIn most scenarios, images still lazy load if you don't specify dimensions, but\nthere are a few edge cases you should be aware of. Without\nwidth\nand\nheight\nspecified, image dimensions default to 0\u00d70 pixels. If you have a gallery of\nimages, the browser might decide that all of them fit inside the viewport at the\nstart, because each image takes up no space and no image is pushed offscreen. In\nthis case, the browser decides to load everything, making the page load more\nslowly.\nFor an example of how\nloading\nworks with large numbers of images, refer to\nthis\ndemo\n.\nYou can also lazy-load images you've defined using the\n<picture>\nelement:\n<picture>\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 800px)\" srcset=\"large.jpg 1x, larger.jpg 2x\">\n  <img src=\"photo.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</picture>\nAlthough the browser decides which image to load from any of the\n<source>\nelements, you only need to add\nloading\nto the fallback\n<img>\nelement.\nAlways eager-load images visible in the first viewport\nFor images that are visible when the user first loads the page, and especially\nfor LCP images, use the browser's default eager loading so they can be available\nright away. For more information, see\nThe performance effects of too much lazy-loading\n.\nUse\nloading=lazy\nonly for images outside the initial viewport. The browser\ncan't lazy-load an image until it knows where the image should be on the page,\nwhich causes them to load more slowly.\n<!-- visible in the viewport -->\n<img src=\"product-1.jpg\" alt=\"...\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\">\n<img src=\"product-2.jpg\" alt=\"...\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\">\n<img src=\"product-3.jpg\" alt=\"...\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\">\n\n<!-- offscreen images -->\n<img src=\"product-4.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"...\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\">\n<img src=\"product-5.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"...\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\">\n<img src=\"product-6.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"...\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\">\nGraceful degradation\nBrowsers that don't support the\nloading\nattribute ignore it. They don't get\nthe benefits of lazy loading, but there's no negative impact from including it.\nFAQ\nSome frequently asked questions about browser-level lazy loading.\nCan I automatically lazy-load images in Chrome?\nPreviously, Chromium automatically lazy-loaded any images that were well suited\nto being deferred if\nLite mode\nwas enabled on Chrome for Android and the\nloading\nattribute was either not\nprovided or set to\nloading=\"auto\"\n. However,\nLite mode and\nloading=\"auto\"\nhave been deprecated\nand there are no plans to provide automatically lazy-load of images in Chrome.\nCan I change how close an image needs to be to the viewport before it loads?\nThese values are hardcoded and can't be changed through the API. However, they\nmight change in the future as browsers experiment with different threshold\ndistances and variables.\nCan CSS background images use the\nloading\nattribute?\nNo, you can only use it with\n<img>\ntags.\nCan\nloading\nwork with images in the viewport that aren't immediately visible?\nUsing\nloading=\"lazy\"\ncan\nprevent images being loaded when they aren't\nvisible but are within the\ncalculated distance\n.\nThese images might be behind a carousel or hidden by CSS for certain screen\nsizes. For example, Chrome, Safari, and Firefox don't load images using\ndisplay: none;\nstyling, either on the image element or on a parent\nelement. However, other image hiding techniques, such as using\nopacity:0\nstyling, still cause the browser to load the image. Always test your\nimplementation thoroughly to make sure it's acting as intended.\nChrome 121 changed the behavior for horizontal-scrolling images like carousels. These now use the same thresholds as vertical scrolling. This means for the carousel use case, images will be loaded before they visible in the viewport. This means the image loading is less likely to be noticeable to the user, but at the cost of more downloads. Use\nthe Horizontal Lazy Loading demo\nto compare behaviour in Chrome versus Safari and Firefox.\nWhat if I'm already using a third-party library or a script to lazy-load images?\nWith full support of lazy loading built into modern browsers, you probably don't\nneed a third-party library or script to lazy-load images.\nOne reason to continue to use a third-party library alongside\nloading=\"lazy\"\nis to provide a polyfill for browsers that don't support the attribute, or to\nhave more control over when lazy loading is triggered.\nHow do I handle browsers that don't support lazy loading?\nBrowser-level image lazy loading is well supported across all the major browsers and is recommended for most use cases, to remove the need for extra dependencies on JavaScript.\nHowever, if you have a need to support more browsers or want to have more control over lazy-loading thresholds then you can use a third-party library to lazy-load images on your site.\nYou can use the\nloading\nproperty to detect whether a browser supports the\nfeature:\nif\n(\n'loading'\nin\nHTMLImageElement\n.\nprototype\n)\n{\n// supported in browser\n}\nelse\n{\n// fetch polyfill/third-party library\n}\nFor example,\nlazysizes\nis a popular\nJavaScript lazy loading library. You can detect support for the\nloading\nattribute to load lazysizes as a fallback library only when\nloading\nisn't\nsupported. This works as follows:\nReplace\n<img src>\nwith\n<img data-src>\nto avoid an eager load in\nunsupported browsers. If the\nloading\nattribute is supported, swap\ndata-src\nfor\nsrc\n.\nIf\nloading\nisn't supported, load a fallback from lazysizes and initiate\nit, using the\nlazyload\nclass to indicate which images to lazy-load:\n<!-- Let's load this in-viewport image normally -->\n<img src=\"hero.jpg\" alt=\"\u2026\">\n\n<!-- Let's lazy-load the rest of these images -->\n<img data-src=\"unicorn.jpg\" alt=\"\u2026\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"lazyload\">\n<img data-src=\"cats.jpg\" alt=\"\u2026\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"lazyload\">\n<img data-src=\"dogs.jpg\" alt=\"\u2026\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"lazyload\">\n\n<script>\n  if ('loading' in HTMLImageElement.prototype) {\n    const images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading=\"lazy\"]');\n    images.forEach(img => {\n      img.src = img.dataset.src;\n    });\n  } else {\n    // Dynamically import the LazySizes library\n    const script = document.createElement('script');\n    script.src =\n      'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lazysizes/5.1.2/lazysizes.min.js';\n    document.body.appendChild(script);\n  }\n</script>\nHere's a\ndemo\nof\nthis pattern. Try it in an older browser to see the fallback in action.\nIs lazy loading for iframes also supported in browsers?\nBrowser Support\n77\n79\n121\n16.4\n<iframe loading=lazy>\nhas also been standardized. This lets you lazy-load iframes using the\nloading\nattribute. For more information, see\nIt's time to lazy-load offscreen iframes!\nHow does browser-level lazy loading affect advertisements on a web page?\nAll ads displayed to the user as images or iframes lazy-load just like any other\nimage or iframe.\nHow are images handled when a web page is printed?\nAll images and iframes load immediately when the page is printed.

images without the need to\nwrite custom lazy-loading code or use a separate JavaScript library. Here's a\n[demo](https://mathiasbynens.be/demo/img-loading-lazy) of the feature:\n\n[\n\n](/static/articles/browser-level-image-lazy-loading/video/web-dev-assets/native-lazy-loading/lazyload.webm)\n\nLazy-loaded images load as the user scrolls through the page.\n\nThis page walks through the details of implementing lazy-loading in the browser.\n\n## Why browser-level lazy loading?\n\nAccording to the [HTTP Archive](https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight),\nimages are the most-requested asset type for most websites, and they usually\ntake up more bandwidth than any other resource. At the 90th percentile, sites\nsend over 5 MB of images on desktop and mobile.\n\nPreviously, there were two ways to defer the loading of off-screen images:\n\n- Using the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/intersectionobserver)\n- Using `scroll`, `resize`, or `orientationchange` [event handlers](/articles/lazy-loading-images)\n\nEither option can let developers include lazy loading behavior, and many\ndevelopers have built third-party libraries to provide abstractions that are\neven easier to use.\n\nWith lazy loading supported directly by the browser, however, there's no need for an external library. Browser-level lazy loading also ensures that loading of images still works even if the client disables JavaScript. Note however that loading is only deferred when JavaScript is enabled.\n\n## The `loading` attribute\n\nChrome loads images at different priorities depending on where they're located\nrelative to the device viewport. Images below the viewport are loaded with a\nlower priority, but they're still fetched as the page loads.\n\nYou can use the `loading` attribute to completely defer the loading of offscreen\nimages:\n\n```\n<img src=\"image.png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\u2026\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\">\n```\n\nHere are the supported values for the `loading` attribute:\n\n- `lazy`: Defer loading of the resource until it reaches a\n  [calculated distance](#distance-from-viewport) from the viewport.\n- `eager`: Default loading behavior of the browser, which is the same as not\n  including the attribute and means the image is loaded regardless of where it's\n  located on the page. This is the default, but it can be useful to set\n  explicitly if your tooling automatically adds `loading=\"lazy\"` when there's no\n  explicit value, or if your linter complains if it isn't explicitly set.\n\n### Relationship between the `loading` attribute and fetch priority\n\nThe `eager` value is an instruction to load the image as usual, without delaying\nthe load further if the image is off-screen. It doesn't load the image faster\nthan another image that doesn't have a `loading` attribute.\n\nIf you want to increase the fetch priority of an important image (for example,\nthe LCP image), use [Fetch Priority](/articles/fetch-priority) with\n`fetchpriority=\"high\"`.\n\nAn image with `loading=\"lazy\"` and `fetchpriority=\"high\"` is still delayed while\nit's off-screen, and then fetched with a high priority when it's almost within\nthe viewport. This combination isn't really necessary because the browser would\nlikely load that image with high priority anyway.\n\n### Distance-from-viewport thresholds\n\nAll images that are immediately viewable without scrolling load normally. Images\nfar below the device viewport are only fetched when the user scrolls near them.\n\nChromium's implementation of lazy loading tries to ensure that offscreen images\nare loaded early enough that they finish loading by the time the user scrolls\nto them by fetching them well before they become visible in the viewport.\n\nThe distance threshold varies depending on the following factors:\n\n- The type of image resource being fetched\n- The [effective connection type](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/network-information/)\n\nYou can find the default values for the different effective connection types in\nthe [Chromium source](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/blink/renderer/core/frame/settings.json5;l=963-995).\nYou can experiment with these different thresholds by\n[throttling the network](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/#throttle)\nin DevTools.\n\n## Improved data-savings and distance-from-viewport thresholds\n\nIn July 2020, Chrome made significant improvements to align the image lazy loading distance-from-viewport thresholds to better meet developer expectations.\n\nOn fast connections (4G), we reduced Chrome's distance-from-viewport thresholds from `3000px` to `1250px` and on slower connections (3G or lower), changed the threshold from `4000px` to `2500px`. This change achieves two things:\n\n- `<img loading=lazy>` behaves closer to the experience offered by JavaScript lazy loading libraries.\n- The new distance-from-viewport thresholds still means images will probably have loaded by the time a user has scrolled to them.\n\nYou can find a comparison between the old versus new distance-from-viewport thresholds for one of our demos on a fast connection (4G) next:\n\n![The new and improved thresholds for image lazy loading, reducing the distance-from-viewport thresholds for fast connections from 3000px down to 1250px.](/static/articles/browser-level-image-lazy-loading/image/the-and-improved-thresho-a20c669983f73.png)\n\nComparison of the older versus newer thresholds used for browser-level lazy-loading.\n\nand the new thresholds versus LazySizes (a popular JavaScript lazy loading library):\n\n![The new  distance-from-viewport thresholds in Chrome loading 90KB of images compared to LazySizes loading in 70KB under the same network conditions.](/static/articles/browser-level-image-lazy-loading/image/the-distance-viewport-b99ee22471f28.png)\n\nComparison of the thresholds used for lazy-loading in Chrome and LazySizes.\n\n### Give your images dimension attributes\n\nWhile the browser loads an image, it doesn't immediately know the image's\ndimensions, unless they're explicitly specified. To let the browser reserve\nenough space on a page for images, and avoid disruptive [layout shifts](/articles/cls),\nwe recommend adding `width` and `height` attributes to all `<img>` tags.\n\n```\n<img src=\"image.png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\u2026\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\">\n```\n\nAlternatively, specify their values directly in an inline style:\n\n```\n<img src=\"image.png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\u2026\" style=\"height:200px; width:200px;\">\n```\n\nThe best practice of setting dimensions applies to `<img>` tags regardless of\nwhether you're lazy loading them, but lazy loading can make it more important.\n\nLazy loading in Chromium is implemented in a way that makes images more likely\nto be loaded as soon as they're visible, but there's still a chance that\nthey won't load at the right time. If that happens, not specifying `width` and\n`height` on your images increases their impact on Cumulative Layout Shift. If\nyou can't specify your images' dimensions, lazy loading them can save network\nresources at the risk of these increased [layout shifts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-d_SoCHeWE).\n\nIn most scenarios, images still lazy load if you don't specify dimensions, but\nthere are a few edge cases you should be aware of. Without `width` and `height`\nspecified, image dimensions default to 0\u00d70 pixels. If you have a gallery of\nimages, the browser might decide that all of them fit inside the viewport at the\nstart, because each image takes up no space and no image is pushed offscreen. In\nthis case, the browser decides to load everything, making the page load more\nslowly.\n\nFor an example of how `loading` works with large numbers of images, refer to\nthis [demo](https://mathiasbynens.be/demo/img-loading-lazy).\n\nYou can also lazy-load images you've defined using the `<picture>` element:\n\n```\n<picture>\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 800px)\" srcset=\"large.jpg 1x, larger.jpg 2x\">\n  <img src=\"photo.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</picture>\n```\n\nAlthough the browser decides which image to load from any of the `<source>`\nelements, you only need to add `loading` to the fallback `<img>` element.\n\n## Always eager-load images visible in the first viewport\n\nFor images that are visible when the user first loads the page, and especially\nfor LCP images, use the browser's default eager loading so they can be available\nright away. For more information, see [The performance effects of too much lazy-loading](/articles/lcp-lazy-loading).\n\nUse `loading=lazy` only for images outside the initial viewport. The browser\ncan't lazy-load an image until it knows where the image should be on the page,\nwhich causes them to load more slowly.\n\n```\n<!-- visible in the viewport -->\n<img src=\"product-1.jpg\" alt=\"...\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\">\n<img src=\"product-2.jpg\" alt=\"...\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\">\n<img src=\"product-3.jpg\" alt=\"...\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\">\n\n<!-- offscreen images -->\n<img src=\"product-4.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"...\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\">\n<img src=\"product-5.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"...\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\">\n<img src=\"product-6.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"...\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\">\n```\n\n## Graceful degradation\n\nBrowsers that don't support the `loading` attribute ignore it. They don't get\nthe benefits of lazy loading, but there's no negative impact from including it.\n\n## FAQ\n\nSome frequently asked questions about browser-level lazy loading.\n\n### Can I automatically lazy-load images in Chrome?\n\nPreviously, Chromium automatically lazy-loaded any images that were well suited\nto being deferred if [Lite mode](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/04/data-saver-is-now-lite-mode.html)\nwas enabled on Chrome for Android and the `loading` attribute was either not\nprovided or set to `loading=\"auto\"`. However,\n[Lite mode and `loading=\"auto\"` have been deprecated](https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/151853370/sunsetting-chrome-lite-mode-in-m100-and-older)\nand there are no plans to provide automatically lazy-load of images in Chrome.\n\n### Can I change how close an image needs to be to the viewport before it loads?\n\nThese values are hardcoded and can't be changed through the API. However, they\nmight change in the future as browsers experiment with different threshold\ndistances and variables.\n\n### Can CSS background images use the `loading` attribute?\n\nNo, you can only use it with `<img>` tags.\n\n### Can `loading` work with images in the viewport that aren't immediately visible?\n\nUsing `loading=\"lazy\"` *can* prevent images being loaded when they aren't\nvisible but are within the [calculated distance](#distance-from-viewport).\nThese images might be behind a carousel or hidden by CSS for certain screen\nsizes. For example, Chrome, Safari, and Firefox don't load images using\n`display: none;` styling, either on the image element or on a parent\nelement. However, other image hiding techniques, such as using `opacity:0`\nstyling, still cause the browser to load the image. Always test your\nimplementation thoroughly to make sure it's acting as intended.\n\nChrome 121 changed the behavior for horizontal-scrolling images like carousels. These now use the same thresholds as vertical scrolling. This means for the carousel use case, images will be loaded before they visible in the viewport. This means the image loading is less likely to be noticeable to the user, but at the cost of more downloads. Use [the Horizontal Lazy Loading demo](https://chrome.dev/horizontal-lazy-loading/) to compare behaviour in Chrome versus Safari and Firefox.\n\n### What if I'm already using a third-party library or a script to lazy-load images?\n\nWith full support of lazy loading built into modern browsers, you probably don't\nneed a third-party library or script to lazy-load images.\n\nOne reason to continue to use a third-party library alongside `loading=\"lazy\"`\nis to provide a polyfill for browsers that don't support the attribute, or to\nhave more control over when lazy loading is triggered.\n\n### How do I handle browsers that don't support lazy loading?\n\nBrowser-level image lazy loading is well supported across all the major browsers and is recommended for most use cases, to remove the need for extra dependencies on JavaScript.\n\nHowever, if you have a need to support more browsers or want to have more control over lazy-loading thresholds then you can use a third-party library to lazy-load images on your site.\n\nYou can use the `loading` property to detect whether a browser supports the\nfeature:\n\n```\nif ('loading' in HTMLImageElement.prototype) {\n  // supported in browser\n} else {\n  // fetch polyfill/third-party library\n}\n```\n\nFor example, [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes) is a popular\nJavaScript lazy loading library. You can detect support for the `loading`\nattribute to load lazysizes as a fallback library only when `loading` isn't\nsupported. This works as follows:\n\n- Replace `<img src>` with `<img data-src>` to avoid an eager load in\n  unsupported browsers. If the `loading` attribute is supported, swap `data-src`\n  for `src`.\n- If `loading` isn't supported, load a fallback from lazysizes and initiate\n  it, using the `lazyload` class to indicate which images to lazy-load:\n\n```\n<!-- Let's load this in-viewport image normally -->\n<img src=\"hero.jpg\" alt=\"\u2026\">\n\n<!-- Let's lazy-load the rest of these images -->\n<img data-src=\"unicorn.jpg\" alt=\"\u2026\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"lazyload\">\n<img data-src=\"cats.jpg\" alt=\"\u2026\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"lazyload\">\n<img data-src=\"dogs.jpg\" alt=\"\u2026\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"lazyload\">\n\n<script>\n  if ('loading' in HTMLImageElement.prototype) {\n    const images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading=\"lazy\"]');\n    images.forEach(img => {\n      img.src = img.dataset.src;\n    });\n  } else {\n    // Dynamically import the LazySizes library\n    const script = document.createElement('script');\n    script.src =\n      'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lazysizes/5.1.2/lazysizes.min.js';\n    document.body.appendChild(script);\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\nHere's a [demo](https://lazy-loading.firebaseapp.com/lazy_loading_lib.html) of\nthis pattern. Try it in an older browser to see the fallback in action.\n\n### Is lazy loading for iframes also supported in browsers?\n\nBrowser Support\n\n- ![Chrome: 77.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg

standardized. This lets you lazy-load iframes using the `loading`\nattribute. For more information, see [It's time to lazy-load offscreen iframes!](/articles/iframe-lazy-loading)\n\n### How does browser-level lazy loading affect advertisements on a web page?\n\nAll ads displayed to the user as images or iframes lazy-load just like any other\nimage or iframe.\n\n### How are images handled when a web page is printed?\n\nAll images and iframes load immediately when the page is printed. See\n[issue #875403](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=875403) for details.\n\n### Does Lighthouse recognize browser-level lazy loading?\n\n[Lighthouse 6.0](/articles/lighthouse-whats-new-6) and higher factor in\napproaches for offscreen image lazy loading that can use different thresholds,\nletting them pass the\n[Defer offscreen images](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/offscreen-images) audit.\n\n## Lazy-load images to improve performance\n\nBrowser support for lazy loading images can make it significantly easier for you\nto improve your pages' performance.\n\nAre you noticing any unusual behavior with this feature enabled in Chrome? [File a bug](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/new?component=1456178&title=%5BLazyLoad%5D:&description=Application%20Version%20(from%20%22Chrome%20Settings%20%3E%20About%20Chrome%22):%20%0DAndroid%20Build%20Number%20(from%20%22Android%20Settings%20%3E%20About%20Phone%2FTablet%22):%20%0DDevice:%20%0D%0DSteps%20to%20reproduce:%20%0D%0DObserved%20behavior:%20%0D%0DExpected%20behavior:%20%0D%0DFrequency:%20%0D%3Cnumber%20of%20times%20you%20were%20able%20to%20reproduce%3E%20%0D%0DAdditional%20comments:%20%0D&pli=1&authuser=0&template=0)!\n\nExcept as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), and code samples are licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
