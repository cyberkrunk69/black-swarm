Web fonts enable all of the above and more: the text is selectable, searchable, zoomable, and high-DPI friendly, providing consistent and sharp text rendering regardless of the screen size and resolution. WebFonts are critical to good design, UX, and performance.\nWeb font optimization is a critical piece of the overall performance strategy. Each font is an additional resource, and some fonts may block rendering of the text, but just because the page is using WebFonts doesn't mean that it has to render slower. On the contrary, optimized fonts, combined with a judicious strategy for how they are loaded and applied on the page, can help reduce the total page size and improve page rendering times.\nAnatomy of a web font\nA\nweb font\nis a collection of glyphs, and each glyph is a vector shape that describes a letter or symbol. As a result, two simple variables determine the size of a particular font file: the complexity of the vector paths of each glyph and the number of glyphs in a particular font. For example, Open Sans, which is one of the most popular WebFonts, contains 897 glyphs, which include Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic characters.\nWhen picking a font, it's important to consider which character sets are supported. If you need to localize your page content to multiple languages, you should use a font that can deliver a consistent look and experience to your users. For example,\nGoogle's Noto font family\naims to support all the world's languages. Note, however, that the total size of Noto, with all languages included, results in a 1.1GB+ ZIP download.\nIn this post you will find out how to reduce the delivered filesize of your web fonts.\nWeb font formats\nToday there are two recommeded font container formats in use on the web:\nEOT\nTTF\nWOFF\nWOFF2\n.\nWOFF\nand\nWOFF 2.0\nenjoy wide support and are supported by all modern browsers.\nServe WOFF 2.0 variant to modern browsers.\nIf absolutely necessary\u2014such as if you still need to support Internet Explorer 11, for example\u2014serve the WOFF as a fallback.\nAlternatively, consider not using web fonts for legacy browsers and falling back to the system fonts. This may be more performant for older, more constrained, devices as well.\nSince WOFF and WOFF 2.0 cover all bases for modern and legacy browsers still in use, use of EOT and TTF are no longer necessary and can result in longer web font download times.\nWeb fonts and compression\nBoth WOFF and WOFF 2.0 have built-in compression. WOFF 2.0's internal compression uses Brotli, and offers up to 30% better compression than WOFF. For more information, see\nthe WOFF 2.0 evaluation report\n.\nFinally, it's worth noting that some font formats contain additional metadata, such as\nfont hinting\nand\nkerning\ninformation that may not be necessary on some platforms, which allows for further file-size optimization. For example,\nGoogle Fonts\nmaintains 30+ optimized variants for each font and automatically detects and delivers the optimal variant for each platform and browser.\nDefine a font family with\n@font-face\nThe\n@font-face\nCSS at-rule allows you to define the location of a particular font resource, its style characteristics, and the Unicode codepoints for which it should be used. A combination of such\n@font-face\ndeclarations can be used to construct a \"font family,\" which the browser will use to evaluate which font resources need to be downloaded and applied to the current page.\nConsider a variable font\nVariable fonts can significantly reduce the filesize of your fonts in cases where you need multiple variants of a font. Instead of needing to load the regular and bold styles plus their italic versions, you can load a single file that contains all of the information. However, variable font file sizes will be larger than an individual font variant\u2014though smaller than the combination of many variants. Rather than one large variable font, it may be better to serve critical font variants first, with other variants downloaded later.\nVariable fonts are now supported by all modern browsers, find out more in the\nIntroduction to variable fonts on the web\n.\nSelect the right format\nEach\n@font-face\ndeclaration provides the name of the font family, which acts as a logical group of multiple declarations,\nfont properties\nsuch as style, weight, and stretch, and the\nsrc descriptor\n, which specifies a prioritized list of locations for the font resource.\n@\nfont-face\n{\nfont-family\n:\n'Awesome Font'\n;\nfont-style\n:\nnormal\n;\nfont-weight\n:\n400\n;\nsrc\n:\nlocal\n(\n'Awesome Font'\n),\nurl\n(\n'/fonts/awesome.woff2'\n)\nformat\n(\n'woff2'\n),\n/* Only serve WOFF if necessary. Otherwise,\nWOFF 2.0 is fine by itself. */\nurl\n(\n'/fonts/awesome.woff'\n)\nformat\n(\n'woff'\n);\n}\n@\nfont-face\n{\nfont-family\n:\n'Awesome Font'\n;\nfont-style\n:\nitalic\n;\nfont-weight\n:\n400\n;\nsrc\n:\nlocal\n(\n'Awesome Font Italic'\n),\nurl\n(\n'/fonts/awesome-i.woff2'\n)\nformat\n(\n'woff2'\n),\nurl\n(\n'/fonts/awesome-i.woff'\n)\nformat\n(\n'woff'\n);\n}\nFirst, note that the above examples define a single\nAwesome Font\nfamily with two styles (normal and\nitalic\n), each of which points to a different set of font resources. In turn, each\nsrc\ndescriptor contains a prioritized, comma-separated list of resource variants:\nThe\nlocal()\ndirective allows you to reference, load, and use locally installed fonts. If the user already has the font installed on their system, this bypasses the network entirely, and is the fastest.\nThe\nurl()\ndirective allows you to load external fonts, and are allowed to contain an optional\nformat()\nhint indicating the format of the font referenced by the provided URL.\nWhen the browser determines that the font is needed, it iterates through the provided resource list in the specified order and tries to load the appropriate resource. For example, following the example above:\nThe browser performs page layout and determines which font variants are required to render the specified text on the page. Fonts that aren't part of the page's\nCSS Object Model (CSSOM)\nare not downloaded by the browser, as they are not required.\nFor each required font, the browser checks if the font is available locally.\nIf the font is not available locally, the browser iterates over external definitions:\nIf a format hint is present, the browser checks if it supports the hint before initiating the download. If the browser doesn't support the hint, the browser advances to the next one.\nIf no format hint is present, the browser downloads the resource.\nThe combination of local and external directives with appropriate format hints allows you to specify all of the available font formats and let the browser handle the rest. The browser determines which resources are required and selects the optimal format.\nUnicode-range subsetting\nIn addition to font properties such as style, weight, and stretch, the\n@font-face\nrule allows you to define a set of Unicode codepoints supported by each resource. This enables you to split a large Unicode font into smaller subsets (for example, Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek subsets) and only download the glyphs required to render the text on a particular page.\nThe\nunicode-range\ndescriptor\nallows you to specify a comma-delimited list of range values, each of which can be in one of three different forms:\nSingle codepoint (for example,\nU+416\n)\nInterval range (for example,\nU+400-4ff\n): indicates the start and end codepoints of a range\nWildcard range (for example,\nU+4??\n):\n?\ncharacters indicate any hexadecimal digit\nFor example, you can split your\nAwesome Font\nfamily into Latin and Japanese\nsubsets, each of which the browser downloads on an as-needed basis:\n@\nfont-face\n{\nfont-family\n:\n'Awesome Font'\n;\nfont-style\n:\nnormal\n;\nfont-weight\n:\n400\n;\nsrc\n:\nlocal\n(\n'Awesome Font'\n),\nurl\n(\n'/fonts/awesome-l.woff2'\n)\nformat\n(\n'woff2'\n);\n/* Latin glyphs */\nunicode-range\n:\nU\n+\n000-5FF\n;\n}\n@\nfont-face\n{\nfont-family\n:\n'Awesome Font'\n;\nfont-style\n:\nnormal\n;\nfont-weight\n:\n400\n;\nsrc\n:\nlocal\n(\n'Awesome Font'\n),\nurl\n(\n'/fonts/awesome-jp.woff2'\n)\nformat\n(\n'woff2'\n);\n/* Japanese glyphs */\nunicode-range\n:\nU\n+\n3000-9FFF\n,\nU\n+\nff\n??;\n}\nThe use of Unicode range subsets and separate files for each stylistic variant of the font allows you to define a composite font family that is both faster and more efficient to download. Visitors only download the variants and subsets they need, and they aren't forced to download subsets that they may never see or use on the page.\nNearly all browsers\nsupport\nunicode-range\n. For compatibility with older browsers you may need to fall back to \"manual subsetting\". In this case you have to fall back to providing a single font resource that contains all the necessary subsets and hide the rest from the browser. For example, if the page is only using Latin characters, then you can strip other glyphs and serve that particular subset as a standalone resource.\nDetermine which subsets are needed:\nIf the browser supports unicode-range subsetting, then it will automatically select the right subset. The page just needs to provide the subset files and specify appropriate unicode-ranges in the\n@font-face\nrules.\nIf the browser doesn't support unicode-range subsetting, then the page needs to hide all unnecessary subsets; that is, the developer must specify the required subsets.\nGenerate font subsets:\nUse the open-source\npyftsubset tool\nto subset and optimize your fonts.\nSome font servers\u2014such as Google Font\u2014will automatically subset by default.\nSome font services allow manual subsetting via custom query parameters, which you can use to manually specify the required subset for your page. Consult the documentation from your font provider.\nFont selection and synthesis\nEach font family may be composed of multiple stylistic variants (regular, bold, italic) and multiple weights for each style. Each of which, in turn, may contain very different glyph shapes\u2014for example, different spacing, sizing, or a different shape altogether.\nThe above diagram illustrates a font family that offers three different bold weights:\n400 (regular).\n700 (bold).\n900 (extra bold).\nAll other in-between variants (indicated in gray) are automatically mapped to the closest variant by the browser.\nWhen a weight is specified for which no face exists, a face with a nearby weight is used. In general, bold weights map to faces with heavier weights and light weights map to faces with lighter weights.\nCSS font matching algorithm\nSimilar logic applies to\nitalic\nvariants. The font designer controls which variants they will produce, and you control which variants you'll use on the page. Because each variant is a separate download, it's a good idea to keep the number of variants small. For example, you can define two bold variants for the\nAwesome Font\nfamily:\n@\nfont-face\n{\nfont-family\n:\n'Awesome Font'\n;\nfont-style\n:\nnormal\n;\nfont-weight\n:\n400\n;\nsrc\n:\nlocal\n(\n'Awesome Font'\n),\nurl\n(\n'/fonts/awesome-l.woff2'\n)\nformat\n(\n'woff2'\n);\n/* Latin glyphs */\nunicode-range\n:\nU\n+\n000-5FF\n;\n}\n@\nfont-face\n{\nfont-family\n:\n'Awesome Font'\n;\nfont-style\n:\nnormal\n;\nfont-weight\n:\n700\n;\nsrc\n:\nlocal\n(\n'Awesome Font'\n),\nurl\n(\n'/fonts/awesome-l-700.woff2'\n)\nformat\n(\n'woff2'\n);\n/* Latin glyphs */\nunicode-range\n:\nU\n+\n000-5FF\n;\n}\nThe above example declares the\nAwesome Font\nfamily that is composed of two resources that cover the same set of Latin glyphs (\nU+000-5FF\n) but offer two different \"weights\": normal (400) and bold (700). However, what happens if one of your CSS rules specifies a different font weight, or sets the\nfont-style\nproperty to\nitalic\n?\nIf an exact font match isn't available, the browser substitutes the closest match.\nIf no stylistic match is found (for example, no italic variants were declared in the example above), then the browser synthesizes its own font variant.\nThe example above illustrates the difference between the actual vs. synthesized font results for Open Sans. All synthesized variants are generated from a single 400-weight font. As you can see, there's a noticeable difference in the results. The details of how to generate the bold and oblique variants are not specified. Therefore, the results vary from browser to browser, and are highly dependent on the font.\nWeb font size optimization checklist\nAudit and monitor your font use:\ndon't use too many fonts on your pages, and, for each font, minimize the number of used variants. This helps produce a more consistent and a faster experience for your users.\nAvoid legacy formats if possible:\nEOT, TTF, and WOFF formats are larger than WOFF 2.0. EOT and TTF are strictly unnecessary formats, where as WOFF may be acceptable if you need to support Internet Explorer 11. If you're only target modern browsers, using WOFF 2.0 only is the simplest and most performant option.\nSubset your font resources:\nmany fonts can be subset, or split into multiple unicode-ranges to deliver just the glyphs that a particular page requires. This reduces the file size and improves the download speed of the resource. However, when defining the subsets, be careful to optimize for font re-use. For example, don't download a different but overlapping set of characters on each page. A\ngood practice is to subset based on script: for example, Latin, and Cyrillic.\nGive precedence to\nlocal()\nin your\nsrc\nlist:\nlisting\nlocal('Font Name')\nfirst in your\nsrc\nlist ensures that HTTP requests aren't made for fonts that are already installed.\nUse\nLighthouse\nto test for\ntext compression\n.\nEffects on Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)\nDepending on your page's content, text nodes can be considered candidates for\nLargest Contentful Paint (LCP)\n. It's therefore vital to ensure your web fonts are as small as possible by following the advice in this article so that your users will see the text on your page\nas soon as they possibly can\n.\nIf you're concerned that, despite your optimization efforts, page text might take too long to appear because of large web font resource, the\nfont-display\nproperty has a number of settings that can help you to\navoid invisible text\nwhile a font is downloading. However, using the\nswap\nvalue may cause significant layout shifts that affect your site's\nCumulative Layout Shift (CLS)\n. Consider using the\noptional\nor\nfallback\nvalues if possible.\nIf your web fonts are crucial to your branding\u2014and by extension, the user experience\u2014 consider preloading your fonts so that the browser has a head start on requesting them. This can reduce both the swap period if you use\nfont-display: swap\n, or the blocking period if you're not using\nfont-display\n.\nExcept as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 License\n, and code samples are licensed under the\nApache 2.0 License\n.

For example, [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) maintains 30+ optimized variants for each font and automatically detects and delivers the optimal variant for each platform and browser.\n\n## Define a font family with `@font-face`\n\nThe `@font-face` CSS at-rule allows you to define the location of a particular font resource, its style characteristics, and the Unicode codepoints for which it should be used. A combination of such `@font-face` declarations can be used to construct a \"font family,\" which the browser will use to evaluate which font resources need to be downloaded and applied to the current page.\n\n### Consider a variable font\n\nVariable fonts can significantly reduce the filesize of your fonts in cases where you need multiple variants of a font.

In turn, each `src` descriptor contains a prioritized, comma-separated list of resource variants:\n\n- The `local()` directive allows you to reference, load, and use locally installed fonts. If the user already has the font installed on their system, this bypasses the network entirely, and is the fastest.\n- The `url()` directive allows you to load external fonts, and are allowed to contain an optional `format()` hint indicating the format of the font referenced by the provided URL.\n\nWhen the browser determines that the font is needed, it iterates through the provided resource list in the specified order and tries to load the appropriate resource.

Fonts that aren't part of the page's [CSS Object Model (CSSOM)](/articles/critical-rendering-path/constructing-the-object-model#css_object_model_cssom) are not downloaded by the browser, as they are not required.\n2.

This reduces the file size and improves the download speed of the resource. However, when defining the subsets, be careful to optimize for font re-use. For example, don't download a different but overlapping set of characters on each page. A\n  good practice is to subset based on script: for example, Latin, and Cyrillic.\n- **Give precedence to `local()` in your `src` list:** listing `local('Font Name')` first in your `src` list ensures that HTTP requests aren't made for fonts that are already installed.\n- **Use [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview)** to test for [text compression](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/uses-text-compression).\n\n## Effects on Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)\n\nDepending on your page's content, text nodes can be considered candidates for [Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](/articles/lcp). It's therefore vital to ensure your web fonts are as small as possible by following the advice in this article so that your users will see the text on your page [as soon as they possibly can](/articles/optimize-webfont-loading).\n\nIf you're concerned that, despite your optimization efforts, page text might take too long to appear because of large web font resource, the `font-display` property has a number of settings that can help you to [avoid invisible text](/articles/avoid-invisible-text) while a font is downloading. However, using the `swap` value may cause significant layout shifts that affect your site's [Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)](/articles/cls). Consider using the `optional` or `fallback` values if possible.\n\nIf your web fonts are crucial to your branding\u2014and by extension, the user experience\u2014 consider preloading your fonts so that the browser has a head start on requesting them. This can reduce both the swap period if you use `font-display: swap`, or the blocking period if you're not using `font-display`.\n\nExcept as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), and code samples are licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
