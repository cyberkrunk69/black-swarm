Other guides discuss [style](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Containment/Container_size_and_style_queries#container_style_queries) and [scroll-state](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Conditional_rules/Container_scroll-state_queries) container queries in detail.\n\n![Two different query types. First, a media query based on the viewport's width, which is the full width of the browser. Second, a container query based on the width of a container element.](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Containment/Container_queries/container-query.svg)\n\n## [Using container size queries](#using_container_size_queries)\n\nWhile container queries apply styles based on the container type, container size queries apply styles specifically based on the container's dimensions. To use container size queries, you need to declare a **containment context** on an element so that the browser knows you might want to query the dimensions of this container later.\nTo do this, use the [`container-type`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/container-type) property with a value of `size`, `inline-size`, or `normal`.\n\nThese values have the following effects:\n\n[`size`](#size)\n:   The query will be based on the [inline and block](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Logical_properties_and_values/Basic_concepts#block_and_inline_dimensions) dimensions of the container.\n    Applies layout, style, and size [containment](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Containment/Using) to the container.\n\n[`inline-size`](#inline-size)\n:   The query will be based on the [inline](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Logical_properties_and_values/Basic_concepts#block_and_inline_dimensions) dimensions of the container.\n    Applies layout, style, and inline-size containment to the element.\n\n[`normal`](#normal)\n:   The element is not a query container for any container size queries, but remains a query container for container style queries.\n\nConsider the following example of a card component for a blog post with a title and some text:\n\nhtml\n\n```\n<div class=\"post\">\n  <div class=\"card\">\n    <h2>Card title</h2>\n    <p>Card content</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nYou can create a containment context using the `container-type` property:\n\ncss\n\n```\n.post {\n  container-type: inline-size;\n}\n```\n\nNext, use the [`@container`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@container) at-rule to define a container query.\nThe query in the following example will apply styles to elements based on the size of the nearest ancestor with a containment context.\nSpecifically, this query will apply a larger font size for the card title if the container is wider than `700px`:\n\ncss\n\n```\n/* Default heading styles for the card title */\n.card h2 {\n  font-size: 1em;\n}\n\n/* If the container is larger than 700px */\n@container (width > 700px) {\n  .card h2 {\n    font-size: 2em;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nUsing container queries, the card can be reused in multiple areas of a page without needing to know specifically where it will be placed each time.\nIf the container with the card is narrower than `700px`, the font of the card title will be small, and if the card is in a container that's wider than `700px`, the font of the card title will be bigger.\n\nFor more information on the syntax of container queries, see the [`@container`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@container) page.\n\n### [Naming containment contexts](#naming_containment_contexts)\n\nIn the previous section, a container query applied styles based on the nearest ancestor with a containment context.\nIt's possible to give a containment context a name using the [`container-name`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/container-name) property. Once named, the name can be used in a `@container` query so as to target a specific container.\nThe following example creates a containment context with the name `sidebar`:\n\ncss\n\n```\n.post {\n  container-type: inline-size;\n  container-name: sidebar;\n}\n```\n\nYou can then target this containment context using the `@container` at-rule:\n\ncss\n\n```\n@container sidebar (width > 700px) {\n  .card {\n    font-size: 2em;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nMore information on naming containment contexts is available on the [`container-name`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/container-name) page.\n\n### [Shorthand container syntax](#shorthand_container_syntax)\n\nThe shorthand way of declaring a containment context is to use the `container` property:\n\ncss\n\n```\n.post {\n  container: sidebar / inline-size;\n}\n```\n\nFor more information on this property, see the [`container`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/container) reference.\n\n### [Container query length units](#container_query_length_units)\n\nWhen applying styles to a container using container queries, you can use container query length units.\nThese units specify a length relative to the dimensions of a query container.\nComponents that use units of length relative to their container are more flexible to use in different containers without having to recalculate concrete length values.\n\nIf no eligible container is available for the query, the container query length unit defaults to the [small viewport unit](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/length#small_viewport_units) for that axis (`sv*`).\n\nThe container query length units are:\n\n- `cqw`: 1% of a query container's width\n- `cqh`: 1% of a query container's height\n- `cqi`: 1% of a query container's inline size\n- `cqb`: 1% of a query container's block size\n- `cqmin`: The smaller value of either `cqi` or `cqb`\n- `cqmax`: The larger value of either `cqi` or `cqb`\n\nThe following example uses the `cqi` unit to set the font size of a heading based on the inline size of the container:\n\ncss\n\n```\n@container (width > 700px) {\n  .card h2 {\n    font-size: max(1.5em, 1.23em + 2cqi);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor more information on these units, see the [Container query length units](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/length#container_query_length_units) reference.\n\n## [Fallbacks for container queries](#fallbacks_for_container_queries)\n\nFor browsers that don't yet support container queries, [`grid`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/grid) and [`flex`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/flex) can be used to create a similar effect for the card component used on this page.\nThe following example uses a [`grid-template-columns`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/grid-template-columns) declaration to create a two-column layout for the card component.\n\ncss\n\n```\n.card {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr;\n}\n```\n\nIf you want to use a single-column layout for devices with a smaller viewport, you can use a media query to change the grid template:\n\ncss\n\n```\n@media (width <= 700px) {\n  .card {\n    grid-template-columns: 1fr;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## [See also](#see_also)\n\n- [Media queries](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Media_queries)\n- CSS
