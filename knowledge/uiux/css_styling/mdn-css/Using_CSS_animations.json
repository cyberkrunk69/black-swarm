  "content": "Using CSS animations\nCSS animations\nmake it possible to animate transitions from one CSS style configuration to another. Animations consist of two components: a style describing the CSS animation and a set of keyframes that indicate the start and end states of the animation's style, as well as possible intermediate waypoints.\nThere are three key advantages to CSS animations over traditional script-driven animation techniques:\nYou can create basic animations with a few lines of CSS; no JavaScript required.\nThe animations run well, even under moderate system load. Simple animations can often perform poorly in JavaScript. The rendering engine can use frame-skipping and other techniques to keep the performance as smooth as possible.\nLetting the browser control the animation sequence lets the browser optimize performance and efficiency by, for example, reducing the update frequency of animations running in tabs that aren't currently visible.\nConfiguring an animation\nTo create a CSS animation sequence, you style the element you want to animate with the\nanimation\nproperty or its sub-properties. This lets you configure the timing, duration, and other details of how the animation sequence should progress. This does\nnot\nconfigure the actual appearance of the animation, which is done using the\n@keyframes\nat-rule as described in the\nDefining animation sequence using keyframes\nsection below.\nThe sub-properties of the\nanimation\nproperty are:\nanimation-composition\nSpecifies the\ncomposite operation\nto use when multiple animations affect the same property simultaneously. This property is not part of the\nanimation\nshorthand property.\nanimation-delay\nSpecifies the delay between an element loading and the start of an animation sequence and whether the animation should start immediately from its beginning or partway through the animation.\nanimation-direction\nSpecifies whether an animation's first iteration should be forward or backward and whether subsequent iterations should alternate direction on each run through the sequence or reset to the start point and repeat.\nanimation-duration\nSpecifies the length of time in which an animation completes one cycle.\nanimation-fill-mode\nSpecifies how an animation applies styles to its target before and after it runs.\nNote:\nIn the case of animation\nforwards\nfill mode, animated properties behave as if included in a set\nwill-change\nproperty value. If a new stacking context was created during the animation, the target element retains the stacking context after the animation has finished.\nanimation-iteration-count\nSpecifies the number of times an animation should repeat.\nanimation-name\nSpecifies the name of the\n@keyframes\nat-rule describing an animation's keyframes.\nanimation-play-state\nSpecifies whether to pause or play an animation sequence.\nanimation-timeline\nSpecifies the timeline that is used to control the progress of a CSS animation.\nanimation-timing-function\nSpecifies how an animation transitions through keyframes by establishing acceleration curves.\nDefining an animation sequence using keyframes\nAfter you've configured the animation's timing, you need to define the appearance of the animation. This is done by establishing one or more keyframes using the\n@keyframes\nat-rule. Each keyframe describes how the animated element should render at a given time during the animation sequence.\nSince the timing of the animation is defined in the CSS style that configures the animation, keyframes use a\n<percentage>\nto indicate the time during the animation sequence at which they take place. 0% indicates the first moment of the animation sequence, while 100% indicates the final state of the animation. Because these two times are so important, they have special aliases:\nfrom\nand\nto\n. Both are optional. If\nfrom\n/\n0%\nor\nto\n/\n100%\nis not specified, the browser starts or finishes the animation using the computed values of all attributes.\nYou can optionally include additional keyframes that describe intermediate steps between the start and end of the animation.\nUsing the animation shorthand\nThe\nanimation\nshorthand is useful for saving space. As an example, some of the rules we've been using through this article:\ncss\np {\n  animation-duration: 3s;\n  animation-name: slide-in;\n  animation-iteration-count: infinite;\n  animation-direction: alternate;\n}\n...could be replaced by using the\nanimation\nshorthand.\ncss\np {\n  animation: 3s infinite alternate slide-in;\n}\nTo learn more about the sequence in which different animation property values can be specified using the\nanimation\nshorthand, see the\nanimation\nreference page.\nSetting multiple animation property values\nThe CSS animation longhand properties can accept multiple values, separated by commas. This feature can be used when you want to apply multiple animations in a single rule and set different durations, iteration counts, etc., for each of the animations. Let's look at some quick examples to explain the different permutations.\nIn this first example, there are three duration and three iteration count values. So each animation is assigned a value of duration and iteration count with the same position as the animation name. The\nfadeInOut\nanimation is assigned a duration of\n2.5s\nand an iteration count of\n2\n, and the\nbounce\nanimation is assigned a duration of\n1s\nand an iteration count of\n5\n.\ncss\nanimation-name: fadeInOut, moveLeft300px, bounce;\nanimation-duration: 2.5s, 5s, 1s;\nanimation-iteration-count: 2, 1, 5;\nIn this second example, three animation names are set, but there's only one duration and iteration count. In this case, all three animations are given the same duration and iteration count.\ncss\nanimation-name: fadeInOut, moveLeft300px, bounce;\nanimation-duration: 3s;\nanimation-iteration-count: 1;\nIn this third example, three animations are specified, but only two durations and iteration counts. In such cases where there are not enough values in the list to assign a separate one to each animation, the value assignment cycles from the first to the last item in the available list and then cycles back to the first item. So,\nfadeInOut\ngets a duration of\n2.5s\n, and\nmoveLeft300px\ngets a duration of\n5s\n, which is the last value in the list of duration values. The duration value assignment now resets to the first value;\nbounce\n, therefore, gets a duration of\n2.5s\n. The iteration count values (and any other property values you specify) will be assigned in the same way.\ncss\nanimation-name: fadeInOut, moveLeft300px, bounce;\nanimation-duration: 2.5s, 5s;\nanimation-iteration-count: 2, 1;\nIf the mismatch in the number of animations and animation property values is inverted, say there are five\nanimation-duration\nvalues for three\nanimation-name\nvalues, then the extra or unused animation property values, in this case, two\nanimation-duration\nvalues, don't apply to any animation and are ignored.\nExamples\nMaking text slide across the browser window\nThis basic example styles a\n<p>\nelement using the\ntranslate\nand\nscale\ntransition properties so that the text slides in from off the right edge of the browser window.\ncss\np {\n  animation-duration: 3s;\n  animation-name: slide-in;\n}\n\n@keyframes slide-in {\n  from {\n    translate: 150vw 0;\n    scale: 200% 1;\n  }\n\n  to {\n    translate: 0 0;\n    scale: 100% 1;\n  }\n}\nIn this example, the style for the\n<p>\nelement specifies that the animation should take 3 seconds to execute from start to finish, using the\nanimation-duration\nproperty and that the name of the\n@keyframes\nat-rule defining the keyframes for the animation sequence is\nslide-in\n.\nIn this case, we have just two keyframes. The first occurs at\n0%\n(using the alias\nfrom\n). Here, we configure the\ntranslate\nproperty of the element to be at\n150vw\n(that is, beyond the far right edge of the containing element), and the\nscale\nof the element to be 200% (or two times its default inline size), causing the paragraph to be twice as wide as its\n<body>\ncontaining block. This causes the first frame of the animation to have the header drawn off the right edge of the browser window.\nThe second keyframe occurs at\n100%\n(using the alias\nto\n). The\ntranslate\nproperty is set to\n0%\nand the\nscale\nof the element is set to\n1\n, which is\n100%\n. This causes the header to finish its animation in its default state, flush against the left edge of the content area.\nhtml\n<p>\n  The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at\n  last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a\n  languid, sleepy voice.\n</p>\nNote:\nReload page to see the animation.\nAdding another keyframe animation\nLet's add another keyframe to the previous example's animation. Let's say we want Alice's name to turn pink and grow and then shrink back to its original size and color as it moves from right to left. While we could change the\nfont-size\n, changing any properties that impact the box model negatively impacts performance. Instead, we wrap her name in a\n<span>\nand then scale and assign a color to that separately. That requires adding a second animation impacting only the\n<span>\n:\ncss\n@keyframes grow-shrink {\n  25%,\n  75% {\n    scale: 100%;\n  }\n\n  50% {\n    scale: 200%;\n    color: magenta;\n  }\n}\nThe full code now looks like this:\ncss\np {\n  animation-duration: 3s;\n  animation-name: slide-in;\n}\np span {\n  display: inline-block;\n  animation-duration: 3s;\n  animation-name: grow-shrink;\n}\n\n@keyframes slide-in {\n  from {\n    translate: 150vw 0;\n    scale: 200% 1;\n  }\n\n  to {\n    translate: 0 0;\n    scale: 100% 1;\n  }\n}\n\n@keyframes grow-shrink {\n  25%,\n  75% {\n    scale: 100%;\n  }\n\n  50% {\n    scale: 200%;\n    color: magenta;\n  }\n}\nWe've added a\n<span>\naround \"Alice\":\nhtml\n<p>\n  The Caterpillar and <span>Alice</span> looked at each other for some time in\n  silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\n  addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\n</p>\nThis tells the browser the name should be normal for the first and last 25% of the animation, but turn pink while being scaled up and back again in the middle. We set the spans's\ndisplay\nproperty to\ninline-block\nas the\ntransform\nproperties do not affect non-replaced\ninline-level content\n.\nNote:\nReload page to see the animation.\nRepeating the animation\nTo make the animation repeat itself, use the\nanimation-iteration-count\nproperty to indicate how many times to repeat the animation. In this case, let's use\ninfinite\nto have the animation repeat indefinitely:\ncss\np {\n  animation-duration: 3s;\n  animation-name: slide-in;\n  animation-iteration-count: infinite;\n}\n@keyframes slide-in {\n  from {\n    translate: 150vw 0;\n    scale: 200% 1;\n  }\n\n  to {\n    translate: 0 0;\n    scale: 100% 1;\n  }\n}\n<p>\n  The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at\n  last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a\n  languid, sleepy voice.\n</p>\nMaking the animation move back and forth\nThat made it repeat, but it's very odd having it jump back to the start each time it begins animating. What we really want is for it to move back and forth across the screen. That's easily accomplished by setting\nanimation-direction\nto\nalternate\n:\ncss\np {\n  animation-duration: 3s;\n  animation-name: slide-in;\n  animation-iteration-count: infinite;\n  animation-direction: alternate;\n}\n@keyframes slide-in {\n  from {\n    translate: 150vw 0;\n    scale: 200% 1;\n  }\n\n  to {\n    translate: 0 0;\n    scale: 100% 1;\n  }\n}\n<p>\n  The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at\n  last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a\n  languid, sleepy voice.\n</p>\nUsing animation events\nYou can get additional control over animations \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as well as useful information about them \u00e2\u0080\u0094 by making use of animation events. These events, represented by the\nAnimationEvent\nobject, can be used to detect when animations start, finish, and begin a new iteration. Each event includes the time at which it occurred as well as the name of the animation that triggered the event.\nWe'll modify the sliding text example to output some information about each animation event when it occurs, so we can get a look at how they work.\nWe've included the same keyframe animation as the previous example. This animation will last 3 seconds, be called \"slide-in\", repeat 3 times, and travel in an alternate direction each time. In the\n@keyframes\n, the scale and translation are manipulated along the x-axis to make the element slide across the screen.\ncss\n.slide-in {\n  animation-duration: 3s;\n  animation-name: slide-in;\n  animation-iteration-count: 3;\n  animation-direction: alternate;\n}\n@keyframes slide-in {\n  from {\n    translate: 150vw 0;\n    scale: 200% 1;\n  }\n\n  to {\n    translate: 0 0;\n    scale: 100% 1;\n  }\n}\nAdding the animation event listeners\nWe'll use JavaScript code to listen for all three possible animation events. This code configures our event listeners; we call it when the document is first loaded in order to set things up.\njs\nconst element = document.getElementById(\"watch-me\");\nelement.addEventListener(\"animationstart\", listener);\nelement.addEventListener(\"animationend\", listener);\nelement.addEventListener(\"animationiteration\", listener);\n\nelement.className = \"slide-in\";\nThis is pretty standard code; you can get details on how it works in the documentation for\neventTarget.addEventListener()\n. The last thing this code does is set the\nclass\non the element we'll be animating to \"slide-in\"; we do this to start the animation.\nWhy? Because the\nanimationstart\nevent fires as soon as the animation starts, and in our case, that happens before our code runs. So we'll start the animation ourselves by setting the class of the element to the style that gets animated after the fact.\nReceiving the events\nThe events get delivered to the\nlistener()\nfunction, which is shown below.\njs\nfunction listener(event) {\n  const l = document.createElement(\"li\");\n  switch (event.type) {\n    case \"animationstart\":\n      l.textContent = `Started: elapsed time is ${event.elapsedTime}`;\n      break;\n    case \"animationend\":\n      l.textContent = `Ended: elapsed time is ${event.elapsedTime}`;\n      break;\n    case \"animationiteration\":\n      l.textContent = `New loop started at time ${event.elapsedTime}`;\n      break;\n  }\n  document.getElementById(\"output\").appendChild(l);\n}\nThis code, too, is very simple. It looks at the\nevent.type\nto determine which kind of animation event occurred, then adds an appropriate note to the\n<ul>\n(unordered list) we're using to log these events.\nThe output, when all is said and done, looks something like this:\nStarted: elapsed time is 0\nNew loop started at time 3.01200008392334\nNew loop started at time 6.00600004196167\nEnded: elapsed time is 9.234000205993652\nNote that the times are very close to, but not exactly, those expected given the timing established when the animation was configured. Note also that after the final iteration of the animation, the\nanimationiteration\nevent isn't sent; instead, the\nanimationend\nevent is sent.\nJust for the sake of completeness, here's the HTML that displays the page content, including the list into which the script inserts information about the received events:\nhtml\n<h1 id=\"watch-me\">Watch me move</h1>\n<p>\n  This example shows how to use CSS animations to make <code>H1</code>\n  elements move across the page.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In addition, we output some text each time an animation event fires, so you\n  can see them in action.\n</p>\n<ul id=\"output\"></ul>\nAnd here's the live output.\nNote:\nReload page to see the animation.\nAnimating display and content-visibility\nThis example demonstrates how\ndisplay\nand\ncontent-visibility\ncan be animated. This behavior is useful for creating entry/exit animations where you want to for example remove a container from the DOM with\ndisplay: none\n, but have it fade out smoothly with\nopacity\nrather than disappearing immediately.\nSupporting browsers animate\ndisplay\nand\ncontent-visibility\nwith a variation on the\ndiscrete animation type\n. This generally means that properties will flip between two values 50% of the way through animating between the two.\nThere is an exception, however, which is when animating to/from\ndisplay: none\nor\ncontent-visibility: hidden\nto a visible value. In this case, the browser will flip between the two values so that the animated content is shown for the entire animation duration.\nSo for example:\nWhen animating\ndisplay\nfrom\nnone\nto\nblock\n(or another visible\ndisplay\nvalue), the value will flip to\nblock\nat\n0%\nof the animation duration so it is visible throughout.\nWhen animating\ndisplay\nfrom\nblock\n(or another visible\ndisplay\nvalue) to\nnone\n, the value will flip to\nnone\nat\n100%\nof the animation duration so it is visible throughout.\nHTML\nThe HTML contains two\n<p>\nelements with a\n<div>\nin between that we will animate from\ndisplay\nnone\nto\nblock\n.\nhtml\n<p>\n  Click anywhere on the screen or press any key to toggle the\n  <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> between hidden and showing.\n</p>\n\n<div>\n  This is a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element that animates between\n  <code>display: none; opacity: 0</code> and\n  <code>display: block; opacity: 1</code>. Neat, huh?\n</div>\n\n<p>\n  This is another paragraph to show that <code>display: none;</code> is being\n  applied and removed on the above <code>&lt;div&gt; </code>. If only its\n  <code>opacity</code> was being changed, it would always take up the space in\n  the DOM.\n</p>\nCSS\ncss\nhtml {\n  height: 100vh;\n}\n\ndiv {\n  font-size: 1.6rem;\n  padding: 20px;\n  border: 3px solid red;\n  border-radius: 20px;\n  width: 480px;\n  opacity: 0;\n  display: none;\n}\n\n/* Animation classes */\n\ndiv.fade-in {\n  display: block;\n  animation: fade-in 0.7s ease-in forwards;\n}\n\ndiv.fade-out {\n  animation: fade-out 0.7s ease-out forwards;\n}\n\n/* Animation keyframes */\n\n@keyframes fade-in {\n  0% {\n    opacity: 0;\n    display: none;\n  }\n\n  100% {\n    opacity: 1;\n    display: block;\n  }\n}\n\n@keyframes fade-out {\n  0% {\n    opacity: 1;\n    display: block;\n  }\n\n  100% {\n    opacity: 0;\n    display: none;\n  }\n}\nNote the inclusion of the\ndisplay\nproperty in the keyframe animations.\nJavaScript\nFinally, we include a bit of JavaScript to set up event listeners to trigger the animations. Specifically, we add the\nfade-in\nclass to the\n<div>\nwhen we want it to appear, and\nfade-out\nwhen we want it to disappear.\njs\nconst divElem = document.querySelector(\"div\");\nconst htmlElem = document.querySelector(\":root\");\n\nhtmlElem.addEventListener(\"click\", showHide);\ndocument.addEventListener(\"keydown\", showHide);\n\nfunction showHide() {\n  if (divElem.classList[0] === \"fade-in\") {\n    divElem.classList.remove(\"fade-in\");\n    divElem.classList.add(\"fade-out\");\n  } else {\n    divElem.classList.remove(\"fade-out\");\n    divElem.classList.add(\"fade-in\");\n  }\n}\nResult\nThe code renders as follows:\nSee also\nCSS animations\nmodule\nAnimationEvent\nUsing CSS transitions\nUsing the Web Animations API\nHelp improve MDN\nLearn how to contribute\nThis page was last modified on\nDec 15, 2025\nby\nMDN contributors\n.\nView this page on GitHub\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\nReport a problem with this content",

As an example, some of the rules we've been using through this article:\n\ncss\n\n```\np {\n  animation-duration: 3s;\n  animation-name: slide-in;\n  animation-iteration-count: infinite;\n  animation-direction: alternate;\n}\n```\n\n...could be replaced by using the `animation` shorthand.\n\ncss\n\n```\np {\n  animation: 3s infinite alternate slide-in;\n}\n```\n\nTo learn more about the sequence in which different animation property values can be specified using the `animation` shorthand, see the [`animation`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/animation) reference page.\n\n## [Setting multiple animation property values](#setting_multiple_animation_property_values)\n\nThe CSS animation longhand properties can accept multiple values, separated by commas. This feature can be used when you want to apply multiple animations in a single rule and set different durations, iteration counts, etc., for each of the animations. Let's look at some quick examples to explain the different permutations.\n\nIn this first example, there are three duration and three iteration count values. So each animation is assigned a value of duration and iteration count with the same position as the animation name. The `fadeInOut` animation is assigned a duration of `2.5s` and an iteration count of `2`, and the `bounce` animation is assigned a duration of `1s` and an iteration count of `5`.\n\ncss\n\n```\nanimation-name: fadeInOut, moveLeft300px, bounce;\nanimation-duration: 2.5s, 5s, 1s;\nanimation-iteration-count: 2, 1, 5;\n```\n\nIn this second example, three animation names are set, but there's only one duration and iteration count. In this case, all three animations are given the same duration and iteration count.\n\ncss\n\n```\nanimation-name: fadeInOut, moveLeft300px, bounce;\nanimation-duration: 3s;\nanimation-iteration-count: 1;\n```\n\nIn this third example, three animations are specified, but only two durations and iteration counts. In such cases where there are not enough values in the list to assign a separate one to each animation, the value assignment cycles from the first to the last item in the available list and then cycles back to the first item. So, `fadeInOut` gets a duration of `2.5s`, and `moveLeft300px` gets a duration of `5s`, which is the last value in the list of duration values. The duration value assignment now resets to the first value; `bounce`, therefore, gets a duration of `2.5s`. The iteration count values (and any other property values you specify) will be assigned in the same way.\n\ncss\n\n```\nanimation-name: fadeInOut, moveLeft300px, bounce;\nanimation-duration: 2.5s, 5s;\nanimation-iteration-count: 2, 1;\n```\n\nIf the mismatch in the number of animations and animation property values is inverted, say there are five `animation-duration` values for three `animation-name` values, then the extra or unused animation property values, in this case, two `animation-duration` values, don't apply to any animation and are ignored.\n\n## [Examples](#examples)\n\n### [Making text slide across the browser window](#making_text_slide_across_the_browser_window)\n\nThis basic example styles a [`<p>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/p) element using the [`translate`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/translate) and [`scale`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/scale) transition properties so that the text slides in from off the right edge of the browser window.\n\ncss\n\n```\np {\n  animation-duration: 3s;\n  animation-name: slide-in;\n}\n\n@keyframes slide-in {\n  from {\n    translate: 150vw 0;\n    scale: 200% 1;\n  }\n\n  to {\n    translate: 0 0;\n    scale: 100% 1;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the style for the [`<p>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/p) element specifies that the animation should take 3 seconds to execute from start to finish, using the [`animation-duration`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/animation-duration) property and that the name of the [`@keyframes`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@keyframes) at-rule defining the keyframes for the animation sequence is `slide-in`.\n\nIn this case, we have just two keyframes. The first occurs at `0%` (using the alias `from`). Here, we configure the [`translate`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/translate) property of the element to be at `150vw` (that is, beyond the far right edge of the containing element), and the [`scale`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/scale) of the element to be 200% (or two times its default inline size), causing the paragraph to be twice as wide as its `<body>` containing block. This causes the first frame of the animation to have the header drawn off the right edge of the browser window.\n\nThe second keyframe occurs at `100%` (using the alias `to`). The [`translate`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/translate) property is set to `0%` and the [`scale`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/scale) of the element is set to `1`, which is `100%`. This causes the header to finish its animation in its default state, flush against the left edge of the content area.\n\nhtml\n\n```\n<p>\n  The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at\n  last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a\n  languid, sleepy voice.\n</p>\n```\n\n**Note:**\nReload page to see the animation.\n\n### [Adding another keyframe animation](#adding_another_keyframe_animation)\n\nLet's add another keyframe to the previous example's animation. Let's say we want Alice's name to turn pink and grow and then shrink back to its original size and color as it moves from right to left. While we could change the [`font-size`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/font-size), changing any properties that impact the box model negatively impacts performance. Instead, we wrap her name in a [`<span>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/span) and then scale and assign a color to that separately. That requires adding a second animation impacting only the `<span>`:\n\ncss\n\n```\n@keyframes grow-shrink {\n  25%,\n  75% {\n    scale: 100%;\n  }\n\n  50% {\n    scale: 200%;\n    color: magenta;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe full code now looks like this:\n\ncss\n\n```\np {\n  animation-duration: 3s;\n  animation-name: slide-in;\n}\np span {\n  display: inline-block;\n  animation-duration: 3s;\n  animation-name: grow-shrink;\n}\n\n@keyframes slide-in {\n  from {\n    translate: 150vw 0;\n    scale: 200% 1;\n  }\n\n  to {\n    translate: 0 0;\n    scale: 100% 1;\n  }\n}\n\n@keyframes grow-shrink {\n  25%,\n  75% {\n    scale: 100%;\n  }\n\n  50% {\n    scale: 200%;\n    color: magenta;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe've added a [`<span>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/span) around \"Alice\":\n\nhtml\n\n```\n<p>\n  The Caterpillar and <span>Alice</span> looked at each other for some time in\n  silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\n  addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\n</p>\n```\n\nThis tells the browser the name should be normal for the first and last 25% of the animation, but turn pink while being scaled up and back again in the middle. We set the spans's [`display`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/display) property to `inline-block` as the `transform` properties do not affect non-replaced [inline-level content](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Inline-level_content).\n\n**Note:**\nReload page to see the animation.\n\n### [Repeating the animation](#repeating_the_animation)\n\nTo make the animation repeat itself, use the [`animation-iteration-count`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/animation-iteration-count) property to indicate how many times to repeat the animation. In this case, let's use `infinite` to have the animation repeat indefinitely:\n\ncss\n\n```\np {\n  animation-duration: 3s;\n  animation-name: slide-in;\n  animation-iteration-count: infinite;\n}\n```\n\n```\n@keyframes slide-in {\n  from {\n    translate: 150vw 0;\n    scale: 200% 1;\n  }\n\n  to {\n    translate: 0 0;\n    scale: 100% 1;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```\n<p>\n  The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at\n  last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a\n  languid, sleepy voice.\n</p>\n```\n\n### [Making the animation move back and forth](#making_the_animation_move_back_and_forth)\n\nThat made it repeat, but it's very odd having it jump back to the start each time it begins animating. What we really want is for it to move back and forth across the screen. That's easily accomplished by setting [`animation-direction`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/animation-direction) to `alternate`:\n\ncss\n\n```\np {\n  animation-duration: 3s;\n  animation-name: slide-in;\n  animation-iteration-count: infinite;\n  animation-direction: alternate;\n}\n```\n\n```\n@keyframes slide-in {\n  from {\n    translate: 150vw 0;\n    scale: 200% 1;\n  }\n\n  to {\n    translate: 0 0;\n    scale: 100% 1;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```\n<p>\n  The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at\n  last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a\n  languid, sleepy voice.\n</p>\n```\n\n### [Using animation events](#using_animation_events)\n\nYou can get additional control over animations \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as well as useful information about them \u00e2\u0080\u0094 by making use of animation events. These events, represented by the [`AnimationEvent`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/AnimationEvent) object, can be used to detect when animations start, finish, and begin a new iteration. Each event includes the time at which it occurred as well as the name of the animation that triggered the event.\n\nWe'll modify the sliding text example to output some information about each animation event when it occurs, so we can get a look at how they work.\n\nWe've included the same keyframe animation as the previous example. This animation will last 3 seconds, be called \"slide-in\", repeat 3 times, and travel in an alternate direction each time. In the [`@keyframes`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@keyframes), the scale and translation are manipulated along the x-axis to make the element slide across the screen.\n\ncss\n\n```\n.slide-in {\n  animation-duration: 3s;\n  animation-name: slide-in;\n  animation-iteration-count: 3;\n  animation-direction: alternate;\n}\n```\n\n```\n@keyframes slide-in {\n  from {\n    translate: 150vw 0;\n    scale: 200% 1;\n  }\n\n  to {\n    translate: 0 0;\n    scale: 100% 1;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Adding the animation event listeners\n\nWe'll use JavaScript code to listen for all three possible animation events. This code configures our event listeners; we call it when the document is first loaded in order to set things up.\n\njs\n\n```\nconst element = document.getElementById(\"watch-me\");\nelement.addEventListener(\"animationstart\", listener);\nelement.addEventListener(\"animationend\", listener);\nelement.addEventListener(\"animationiteration\", listener);\n\nelement.className = \"slide-in\";\n```\n\nThis is pretty standard code; you can get details on how it works in the documentation for [`eventTarget.addEventListener()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener). The last thing this code does is set the `class` on the element we'll be animating to \"slide-in\"; we do this to start the animation.\n\nWhy? Because the `animationstart` event fires as soon as the animation starts, and in our case, that happens before our code runs. So we'll start the animation ourselves by setting the class of the element to the style that gets animated after the fact.\n\n#### Receiving the events\n\nThe events get delivered to the `listener()` function, which is shown below.\n\njs\n\n```\nfunction listener(event) {\n  const l = document.createElement(\"li\");\n  switch (event.type) {\n    case \"animationstart\":\n      l.textContent = `Started: elapsed time is ${event.elapsedTime}`;\n      break;\n    case \"animationend\":\n      l.textContent = `Ended: elapsed time is ${event.elapsedTime}`;\n      break;\n    case \"animationiteration\":\n      l.textContent = `New loop started at time ${event.elapsedTime}`;\n      break;\n  }\n  document.getElementById(\"output\").appendChild(l);\n}\n```\n\nThis code, too, is very simple. It looks at the [`event.type`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/type) to determine which kind of animation event occurred, then adds an appropriate note to the [`<ul>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/ul) (unordered list) we're using to log these events.\n\nThe output, when all is said and done, looks something like this:\n\n- Started: elapsed time is 0\n- New loop started at time 3.01200008392334\n- New loop started at time 6.00600004196167\n- Ended: elapsed time is 9.234000205993652\n\nNote that the times are very close to, but not exactly, those expected given the timing established when the animation was configured. Note also that after the final iteration of the animation, the `animationiteration` event isn't sent; instead, the `animationend` event is sent.\n\nJust for the sake of completeness, here's the HTML that displays the page content, including the list into which the script inserts information about the received events:\n\nhtml\n\n```\n<h1 id=\"watch-me\">Watch me move</h1>\n<p>\n  This example shows how to use CSS animations to make <code>H1</code>\n  elements move across the page.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In addition, we output some text each time an animation event fires, so you\n  can see them in action.\n</p>\n<ul id=\"output\"></ul>\n```\n\nAnd here's the live output.\n\n**Note:**\nReload page to see the animation.\n\n### [Animating display and content-visibility](#animating_display_and_content-visibility)\n\nThis example demonstrates how [`display`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/display) and [`content-visibility`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/content-visibility) can be animated. This behavior is useful for creating entry/exit animations where you want to for example remove a container from the DOM with `display: none`, but have it fade out smoothly with [`opacity`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/opacity) rather than disappearing immediately.\n\nSupporting browsers animate `display` and `content-visibility` with a variation on the [discrete animation type](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Animations/Animatable_properties#discrete). This generally means that properties will flip between two values 50% of the way through animating between the two.\n\nThere is an exception, however, which is when animating to/from `display: none` or `content-visibility: hidden` to a visible value. In this case, the browser will flip between the two values so that the animated content is shown for the entire animation duration.\n\nSo for example:\n\n- When animating `display` from `none` to `block` (or another visible `display` value), the value will flip to `block` at `0%` of the animation duration so it is visible throughout.\n- When animating `display` from `block` (or another visible `display` value) to `none`, the value will flip to `none` at `100%` of the animation duration so it is visible throughout.\n\n#### HTML\n\nThe HTML contains two [`<p>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/p) elements with a [`<div>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/div) in between that we will animate from `display` `none` to `block`.\n\nhtml\n\n```\n<p>\n  Click anywhere on the screen or press any key to toggle the\n  <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> between hidden and showing.\n</p>\n\n<div>\n  This is a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element that animates between\n  <code>display: none; opacity: 0</code> and\n  <code>display: block; opacity: 1</code>. Neat, huh?\n</div>\n\n<p>\n  This is another paragraph to show that <code>display: none;</code> is being\n  applied and removed on the above <code>&lt;div&gt; </code>. If only its\n  <code>opacity</code> was being changed, it would always take up the space in\n  the DOM.\n</p>\n```\n\n#### CSS\n\ncss\n\n```\nhtml {\n  height: 100vh;\n}\n\ndiv {\n  font-size: 1.6rem;\n  padding: 20px;\n  border: 3px solid red;\n  border-radius: 20px;\n  width: 480px;\n  opacity: 0;\n  display: none;\n}\n\n/* Animation classes */\n\ndiv.fade-in {\n  display: block;\n  animation: fade-in 0.7s ease-in forwards;\n}\n\ndiv.fade-out {\n  animation: fade-out 0.7s ease-out forwards;\n}\n\n/* Animation keyframes */\n\n@keyframes fade-in {\n  0% {\n    opacity: 0;\n    display: none;\n  }\n\n  100% {\n    opacity: 1;\n    display: block;\n  }\n}\n\n@keyframes fade-out {\n  0% {\n    opacity: 1;\n    display: block;\n  }\n\n  100% {\n    opacity: 0;\n    display: none;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote the inclusion of the `display` property in the keyframe animations.\n\n#### JavaScript\n\nFinally, we include a bit of JavaScript to set up event listeners to trigger the animations. Specifically, we add the `fade-in` class to the `<div>` when we want it to appear, and `fade-out` when we want it to disappear.\n\njs\n\n```\nconst divElem = document.querySelector(\"div\");\nconst htmlElem = document.querySelector(\":root\");\n\nhtmlElem.addEventListener(\"click\", showHide);\ndocument.addEventListener(\"keydown\", showHide);\n\nfunction showHide() {\n  if (divElem.classList[0] === \"fade-in\") {\n    divElem.classList.remove(\"fade-in\");\n    divElem.classList.add(\"fade-out\");\n  } else {\n    divElem.classList.remove(\"fade-out\");\n    divElem.classList.add(\"fade-in\");\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Result\n\nThe code renders as follows:\n\n## [See also](#see_also)\n\n- [CSS animations](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Animations) module\n- [`AnimationEvent`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/AnimationEvent \"AnimationEvent\")\n- [Using CSS transitions](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Transitions/Using)\n- [Using the Web Animations API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API/Using_the_Web_Animations_API)\n\n## Help improve MDN\n\nWas this page helpful to you?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\n[Learn how to contribute](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Getting_started)\n\nThis page was last modified on Dec 15, 2025 by [MDN contributors](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Animations/Using/contributors.txt).\n\n[View this page on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/css/guides/animations/using/index.md?plain=1 \"Folder: en-us/web/css/guides/animations/using (Opens in a new tab)\") \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 [Report a problem with this content](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/new?template=page-report.yml&mdn-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FCSS%2FGuides%2FAnimations%2FUsing&metadata=%3C%21--+Do+not+make+changes+below+this+line+--%3E%0A%3Cdetails%3E%0A%3Csummary%3EPage+report+details%3C%2Fsummary%3E%0A%0A*+Folder%3A+%60en-us%2Fweb%2Fcss%2Fguides%2Fanimations%2Fusing%60%0A*+MDN+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FCSS%2FGuides%2FAnimations%2FUsing%0A*+GitHub+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Ffiles%2Fen-us%2Fweb%2Fcss%2Fguides%2Fanimations%2Fusing%2Findex.md%0A*+Last+commit%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fcommit%2F32bdfdb82cf91ce9942b694286dec62be2cc20aa%0A*+Document+last+modified%3A+2025-12-15T12%3A04%3A53.000Z%0A%0A%3C%2Fdetails%3E \"This will take you to GitHub to file a new issue.\")",
