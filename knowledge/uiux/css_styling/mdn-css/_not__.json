The list must not contain a\npseudo-element\n, but any other simple, compound, and complex selectors are allowed.\nDescription\nThere are several unusual effects and outcomes when using\n:not()\nthat you should keep in mind when using it:\nUseless selectors can be written using this pseudo-class. For example,\n:not(*)\nmatches any element which is not an element, which is obviously nonsense, so the accompanying rule will never be applied.\nThis pseudo-class can increase the\nspecificity\nof a rule. For example,\n#foo:not(#bar)\nwill match the same element as the simpler\n#foo\n, but has the higher specificity of two\nid\nselectors.\nThe specificity of the\n:not()\npseudo-class is replaced by the specificity of the most specific selector in its comma-separated argument of selectors; providing the same specificity as if it had been written\n:not(:is(argument))\n.\n:not(.foo)\nwill match anything that isn't\n.foo\n,\nincluding\n<html>\nand\n<body>\n.\nThis selector will match everything that is \"not an X\". This may be surprising when used with\ndescendant combinators\n, since there are multiple paths to select a target element. For instance,\nbody :not(table) a\nwill still apply to links inside a\n<table>\n, since\n<tr>\n,\n<tbody>\n,\n<th>\n,\n<td>\n,\n<caption>\n, etc. can all match the\n:not(table)\npart of the selector. To avoid this, you can use\nbody a:not(table a)\ninstead, which will only apply to links that are not descendants of a table.\nYou can negate several selectors at the same time. Example:\n:not(.foo, .bar)\nis equivalent to\n:not(.foo):not(.bar)\n.\nIf any selector passed to the\n:not()\npseudo-class is invalid or not supported by the browser, the whole rule will be invalidated. The effective way to overcome this behavior is to use\n:is()\npseudo-class, which accepts a forgiving selector list. For example\n:not(.foo, :invalid-pseudo-class)\nwill invalidate a whole rule, but\n:not(:is(.foo, :invalid-pseudo-class))\nwill match any (\nincluding\n<html>\nand\n<body>\n) element that isn't\n.foo\n.\nExamples\nUsing :not() with valid selectors\nThis example shows a few ways of using\n:not()\n.\nHTML\nhtml\n<p>I am a paragraph.</p>\n<p class=\"fancy\">I am so very fancy!</p>\n<div>I am NOT a paragraph.</div>\n<h2>\n  <span class=\"foo\">foo inside h2</span>\n  <span class=\"bar\">bar inside h2</span>\n</h2>\nCSS\ncss\n.fancy {\n  text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px gold;\n}\n\n/* <p> elements that don't have a class `.fancy` */\np:not(.fancy) {\n  color: green;\n}\n\n/* Elements that are not <p> elements */\nbody :not(p) {\n  text-decoration: underline;\n}\n\n/* Elements that are not <div>s or `.fancy` */\nbody :not(div):not(.fancy) {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n\n/* Elements that are not <div>s or `.fancy` */\nbody :not(div, .fancy) {\n  text-decoration: overline underline;\n}\n\n/* Elements inside an <h2> that aren't a <span> with a class of `.foo` */\nh2 :not(span.foo) {\n  color: red;\n}\nResult\nUsing :not() with invalid selectors\nThis example shows the use of\n:not()\nwith invalid selectors and how to prevent invalidation.\nHTML\nhtml\n<p class=\"foo\">I am a paragraph with .foo</p>\n<p class=\"bar\">I am a paragraph with .bar</p>\n<div>I am a div without a class</div>\n<div class=\"foo\">I am a div with .foo</div>\n<div class=\"bar\">I am a div with .bar</div>\n<div class=\"foo bar\">I am a div with .foo and .bar</div>\nCSS\ncss\n/* Invalid rule, does nothing */\np:not(.foo, :invalid-pseudo-class) {\n  color: red;\n  font-style: italic;\n}\n\n/* Select all <p> elements without the `foo` class */\np:not(:is(.foo, :invalid-pseudo-class)) {\n  color: green;\n  border-top: dotted thin currentColor;\n}\n\n/* Select all <div> elements without the `foo` or the `bar` class */\ndiv:not(.foo, .bar) {\n  color: red;\n  font-style: italic;\n}\n\n/* Select all <div> elements without the `foo` or the `bar` class */\ndiv:not(:is(.foo, .bar)) {\n  border-bottom: dotted thin currentColor;\n}\nResult\nThe\np:not(.foo, :invalid-pseudo-class)\nrule is invalid because it contains an invalid selector.
