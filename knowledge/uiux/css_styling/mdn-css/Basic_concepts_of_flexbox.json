  "content": "Basic concepts of flexbox\nThe\nflexible box layout\nmodule (usually referred to as flexbox) is a one-dimensional layout model for distributing space between items and includes numerous alignment capabilities. This article gives an outline of the main features of flexbox, which we will explore in more detail in the rest of these guides.\nWhen we describe flexbox as being one-dimensional we are describing the fact that flexbox deals with layout in one dimension at a time \u00e2\u0080\u0094 either as a row or as a column. This can be contrasted with the two-dimensional model of\nCSS Grid Layout\n, which controls columns and rows together.\nThe two axes of flexbox\nWhen working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the\nmain axis\nand the\ncross axis\n. The\nmain axis\nis defined by the\nflex-direction\nproperty, and the\ncross axis\nruns perpendicular to it. Everything we do with flexbox refers back to these axes, so it is worth understanding how they work from the outset.\nThe main axis\nThe\nmain axis\nis defined by\nflex-direction\n, which has four possible values:\nrow\nrow-reverse\ncolumn\ncolumn-reverse\nShould you choose\nrow\nor\nrow-reverse\n, your main axis will run along the row in the\ninline direction\n.\nChoose\ncolumn\nor\ncolumn-reverse\nand your main axis will run in the\nblock direction\n, from the top of the page to the bottom.\nThe cross axis\nThe\ncross axis\nruns perpendicular to the main axis. Therefore, if your\nflex-direction\n(main axis) is set to\nrow\nor\nrow-reverse\nthe cross axis runs down the columns.\nIf your main axis is\ncolumn\nor\ncolumn-reverse\nthen the cross axis runs along the rows.\nStart and end lines\nAnother vital area of understanding is how flexbox makes no assumption about the writing mode of the document. Flexbox doesn't just assume that all lines of text start at the top left of a document and run towards the right-hand side, with new lines appearing one under the other. Rather, it supports all writing modes, like other\nlogical properties and values\n.\nYou can\nread more about the relationship between flexbox and writing modes\nin a later article; however, the following description should help explain why we do not talk about left and right and top and bottom when we describe the direction that our flex items flow in.\nIf the\nflex-direction\nis\nrow\nand I am working in English, then the start edge of the main axis will be on the left, the end edge on the right.\nIf I were to work in Arabic, then the start edge of my main axis would be on the right and the end edge on the left.\nIn both cases the start edge of the cross-axis is at the top of the flex container and the end edge at the bottom, as both languages have a horizontal writing mode.\nAfter a while, thinking about start and end rather than left and right becomes natural, and will be useful to you when dealing with other layout methods such as CSS Grid Layout which follow the same patterns.\nThe flex container\nAn area of a document that is laid out using flexbox is called a\nflex container\n. To create a\nflex container\n, set the area's\ndisplay\nproperty to\nflex\n. When we do this, the direct children of that container become\nflex items\n. You can explicitly control whether the container itself is displayed inline or in block formatting context using\ninline flex\nor\ninline-flex\nfor inline flex containers or\nblock flex\nor\nflex\nfor block level flex containers.\nInitial values\nAs with all properties in CSS, some initial values are defined, so the contents of a new flex container will behave in the following way:\nItems display in a row (the\nflex-direction\nproperty's default value is\nrow\n).\nThe items start from the start edge of the main axis.\nThe items do not stretch on the main dimension but can shrink (a flex-item's\nflex-grow\nproperty's default value is\n0\nand its\nflex-shrink\nproperty's default value is\n1\n).\nThe items will stretch to fill the size of the cross-axis (the\nalign-items\nproperty's default value is\nstretch\n).\nThe flex-item's\nflex-basis\nproperty's default value is\nauto\n. This means that, in each case, it will be equal to the flex item\nwidth\nin horizontal writing mode, and the flex item\nheight\nin vertical writing mode. If the corresponding\nwidth\n/\nheight\nis also set to\nauto\n, the\nflex-basis\ncontent\nvalue is used instead.\nAll the items will be in a single row (the\nflex-wrap\nproperty's default value is\nnowrap\n), overflowing their container if their combined\nwidth\n/\nheight\nexceeds the containing element\nwidth\n/\nheight\n.\nThe result of this is that your items will all line up in a row, using the size of the content as their size in the main axis. If there are more items than can fit in the container, they will not wrap but will instead overflow. If some items are taller than others, all items will stretch along the full length of the cross-axis.\nYou can see in the live sample below how this looks. Click \"Play\" to open the example in the MDN Playground and edit the items or add new items to try out the initial behavior of flexbox:\nhtml\n<div class=\"box\">\n  <div>One</div>\n  <div>Two</div>\n  <div>Three <br />has <br />extra <br />text</div>\n</div>\ncss\n.box > * {\n  border: 2px solid rgb(96 139 168);\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  background-color: rgb(96 139 168 / 0.2);\n}\n\n.box {\n  border: 2px dotted rgb(96 139 168);\n  display: flex;\n}\nChanging flex-direction\nAdding the\nflex-direction\nproperty to the flex container allows us to change the direction in which our flex items display. Setting\nflex-direction: row-reverse\nwill keep the items displaying along the row, however the start and end lines are switched.\nIf we change\nflex-direction\nto\ncolumn\nthe main axis switches and our items now display in a column. Set\ncolumn-reverse\nand the start and end lines are again switched.\nThe live sample below has\nflex-direction\nset to\nrow-reverse\n. Try the other values \u00e2\u0080\u0094\nrow\n,\ncolumn\nand\ncolumn-reverse\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 to see what happens to the content.\nhtml\n<div class=\"box\">\n  <div>One</div>\n  <div>Two</div>\n  <div>Three</div>\n</div>\ncss\n.box > * {\n  border: 2px solid rgb(96 139 168);\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  background-color: rgb(96 139 168 / 0.2);\n}\n\n.box {\n  border: 2px dotted rgb(96 139 168);\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: row-reverse;\n}\nMulti-line flex containers with flex-wrap\nWhile flexbox is a one dimensional model, it is possible to make flex items wrap across multiple lines. If you do this, you should consider each line as a new flex container. Any space distribution will happen across each line, without reference to the previous or subsequent lines.\nTo cause wrapping behavior add the property\nflex-wrap\nwith a value of\nwrap\n. Now, if your items are too large to all display in one line, they will wrap onto another line. The live sample below contains items that have been given a\nwidth\n. The total width of the items is too wide for the flex container. As\nflex-wrap\nis set to\nwrap\n, the items wrap across multiple lines. If you set it to\nnowrap\n, which is the initial value, they will shrink to fit the container. They shrink because they are using initial flexbox values, including\nflex-shrink: 1\n, that allows items to shrink. Using\nnowrap\nwould cause an\noverflow\nif the items were not able to shrink, or could not shrink small enough to fit.\nhtml\n<div class=\"box\">\n  <div>One</div>\n  <div>Two</div>\n  <div>Three</div>\n</div>\ncss\n.box > * {\n  border: 2px solid rgb(96 139 168);\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  background-color: rgb(96 139 168 / 0.2);\n  width: 200px;\n}\n\n.box {\n  width: 500px;\n  border: 2px dotted rgb(96 139 168);\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n}\nFind out more about wrapping flex items in the guide\nMastering wrapping of flex items\n.\nThe flex-flow shorthand\nYou can combine the two properties\nflex-direction\nand\nflex-wrap\ninto the\nflex-flow\nshorthand.\nIn the live sample below, try changing the first value to one of the allowable values for\nflex-direction\n-\nrow\n,\nrow-reverse\n,\ncolumn\nor\ncolumn-reverse\n, and also change the second to\nwrap\nand\nnowrap\n.\nhtml\n<div class=\"box\">\n  <div>One</div>\n  <div>Two</div>\n  <div>Three</div>\n</div>\ncss\n.box > * {\n  border: 2px solid rgb(96 139 168);\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  background-color: rgb(96 139 168 / 0.2);\n  width: 200px;\n}\n\n.box {\n  width: 500px;\n  border: 2px dotted rgb(96 139 168);\n  display: flex;\n  flex-flow: row wrap;\n}\nProperties applied to flex items\nTo control the inline-size of each flex item, we target them directly via three properties:\nflex-grow\nflex-shrink\nflex-basis\nWe will take a brief look at these properties below, but if you want more comprehensive information, take a look at the\nControlling ratios of flex items on the main axis\nguide.\nBefore we can make sense of these properties we need to consider the concept of\navailable space\n. What we are doing when we change the value of these flex properties is to change the way that available space is distributed amongst our items. This concept of available space is also important when we come to look at aligning items.\nIf we have three 100 pixel-wide items in a container which is 500 pixels wide, then the space we need to lay out our items is 300 pixels. This leaves 200 pixels of available space. If we don't change the initial values then flexbox will put that space after the last item.\nIf we instead would like the items to grow and fill the space, then we need to have a method of distributing the leftover space between the items. The\nflex\nproperties that we apply to the items themselves, enable dictating how that available space should be distributed among the sibling flex items.\nThe flex-basis property\nThe\nflex-basis\nis what defines the size of that item in terms of the space it leaves as available space. The initial value of this property is\nauto\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 in this case the browser looks to see if the item has a size. In the example above, all of the items have a width of 100 pixels. This is used as the\nflex-basis\n.\nIf the items don't have a size then the content's size is used as the flex-basis. This is why when we just declare\ndisplay: flex\non the parent to create flex items, the items all move into a row and take only as much space as they need to display their contents.\nThe flex-grow property\nWith the\nflex-grow\nproperty set to a positive integer, if there is available space, the flex item can grow along the main axis from its\nflex-basis\n. Whether the item stretches to take up all the available space on that axis, or just a portion of the available space depends on if the other items are allowed to grow too and the value of their\nflex-grow\nproperties.\nEach item with a positive value consumes a portion of any available space based on their\nflex-grow\nvalue. If we gave all of our items in the example above a\nflex-grow\nvalue of 1 then the available space in the flex container would be equally shared between our items and they would stretch to fill the container on the main axis. If we give our first item a\nflex-grow\nvalue of 2, and the other items a value of 1 each, there are a total of 4 parts; 2 parts of the available space will be given to the first item (100px out of 200px in the case of the example above) and 1 part each the other two (50px each out of the 200px total).\nThe flex-shrink property\nWhere the\nflex-grow\nproperty deals with adding space in the main axis, the\nflex-shrink\nproperty controls how it is taken away. If we do not have enough space in the container to lay out our items, and\nflex-shrink\nis set to a positive integer, then the item can become smaller than the\nflex-basis\n. As with\nflex-grow\n, different values can be assigned in order to cause one item to shrink faster than others \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an item with a higher value set for\nflex-shrink\nwill shrink faster than its siblings that have lower values.\nAn item can shrink down to its\nmin-content\nsize. This minimum size is taken into account while working out the actual amount of shrinkage that will happen, which means that\nflex-shrink\nhas the potential to appear less consistent than\nflex-grow\nin behavior. We'll therefore take a more detailed look at how this algorithm works in the article\nControlling ratios of items along the main axis\n.\nNote:\nThese values for\nflex-grow\nand\nflex-shrink\nare proportions. Typically if we had all of our items set to\nflex: 1 1 200px\nand then wanted one item to grow at twice the rate, we would set that item to\nflex: 2 1 200px\n. However you could also use\nflex: 10 1 200px\nand\nflex: 20 1 200px\nif you wanted.\nShorthand values for the flex properties\nYou will very rarely see the\nflex-grow\n,\nflex-shrink\n, and\nflex-basis\nproperties used individually; instead they are combined into the\nflex\nshorthand. The\nflex\nshorthand allows you to set the three values in this order \u00e2\u0080\u0094\nflex-grow\n,\nflex-shrink\n,\nflex-basis\n.\nThe live sample below allows you to test out the different values of the flex shorthand; remember that the first value is\nflex-grow\n. Giving this a positive value means the item can grow. The second is\nflex-shrink\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 with a positive value the items can shrink, but only if their total values overflow the main axis. The final value is\nflex-basis\n; this is the value the items are using as their base value to grow and shrink from.\nhtml\n<div class=\"box\">\n  <div class=\"one\">One</div>\n  <div class=\"two\">Two</div>\n  <div class=\"three\">Three</div>\n</div>\ncss\n.box > * {\n  border: 2px solid rgb(96 139 168);\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  background-color: rgb(96 139 168 / 0.2);\n}\n\n.box {\n  border: 2px dotted rgb(96 139 168);\n  display: flex;\n}\n\n.one {\n  flex: 1 1 auto;\n}\n\n.two {\n  flex: 1 1 auto;\n}\n\n.three {\n  flex: 1 1 auto;\n}\nThere are also some predefined shorthand values which cover most of the use cases. You will often see these used in tutorials, and in many cases these are all you will need to use. The predefined values are as follows:\nflex: initial\nflex: auto\nflex: none\nflex: <positive-number>\nThe\ninitial\nvalue is a\nCSS-wide keyword\nthat represents the initial value for a property. Setting\nflex: initial\nresets the item to the\ninitial values\nof the three longhand properties, which is the same as\nflex: 0 1 auto\n. The initial value of\nflex-grow\nis\n0\n, so items will not grow larger than their\nflex-basis\nsize. The initial value of\nflex-shrink\nis\n1\n, so items can shrink if they need to rather than overflowing. The initial value of\nflex-basis\nis\nauto\n. Items will either use any size set on the item in the main dimension, or they will get their size from the content size.\nUsing\nflex: auto\nis the same as using\nflex: 1 1 auto\n; this is similar to\nflex: initial\n, except that the items can grow and fill the container as well as shrink if needed.\nUsing\nflex: none\nwill create fully inflexible flex items. It is as if you wrote\nflex: 0 0 auto\n. The items cannot grow or shrink and will be laid out using flexbox with a\nflex-basis\nof\nauto\n.\nThe shorthand you often see in tutorials is\nflex: 1\nor\nflex: 2\nand so on. This is the same as writing\nflex: 1 1 0\nor\nflex: 2 1 0\nand so on, respectively. The items get minimum size due to\nflex-basis: 0\nand then proportionally grow to fill the available space. In this case, the\nflex-shrink\nvalue of\n1\nis redundant because the items start with minimum size \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they're not given any size that could cause them to overflow the flex container.\nTry these shorthand values in the live sample below.\nhtml\n<div class=\"box\">\n  <div class=\"one\">One</div>\n  <div class=\"two\">Two</div>\n  <div class=\"three\">Three</div>\n</div>\ncss\n.box > * {\n  border: 2px solid rgb(96 139 168);\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  background-color: rgb(96 139 168 / 0.2);\n}\n\n.box {\n  border: 2px dotted rgb(96 139 168);\n  display: flex;\n}\n\n.one {\n  flex: 1;\n}\n\n.two {\n  flex: 1;\n}\n\n.three {\n  flex: 1;\n}\nAlignment, justification and distribution of free space between items\nA key feature of flexbox is the ability to align and justify items on the main- and cross-axes, and to distribute space between flex items. Note that these properties are set on the flex container, not on the items themselves.\nalign-items\nThe\nalign-items\nproperty aligns all the flex items on the cross axis.\nThe initial value for this property is\nstretch\nand is why flex items stretch to the height of the flex container by default (or the width if\nflex-direction\nis set to\ncolumn\nor\ncolumn-reverse\n). This height may come from the tallest item in the container or the size set on the flex container itself.\nYou could instead set\nalign-items\nto\nflex-start\n, or simply\nstart\n, in order to make the items line up at the start of the flex container,\nflex-end\n, or just\nend\n, to align them to the end, or\ncenter\nto align them in the center. Try this in the live sample \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I have given the flex container a height in order that you can see how the items can be moved around inside the container. See what happens if you set the value of align-items to:\nstretch\nflex-start\nflex-end\nstart\nend\ncenter\nbaseline\nlast baseline\nhtml\n<div class=\"box\">\n  <div>One</div>\n  <div>Two</div>\n  <div>Three <br />has <br />extra <br />text</div>\n</div>\ncss\n.box > * {\n  border: 2px solid rgb(96 139 168);\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  background-color: rgb(96 139 168 / 0.2);\n}\n\n.box {\n  width: 500px;\n  height: 130px;\n  border: 2px dotted rgb(96 139 168);\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: flex-start;\n}\nThe\nalign-items\nis set on the flex container and impacts all the flex items. If you want to align a flex item differently from others, you can set the\nalign-self\non the flex item.\njustify-content\nThe\njustify-content\nproperty is used to align the items on the main axis, the direction in which\nflex-direction\nhas set the flow. The initial value is\nflex-start\nwhich will line the items up at the start edge of the container, but you could also set the value to\nflex-end\nto line them up at the end, or\ncenter\nto line them up in the center.\nYou can also use the value\nspace-between\nto take all the spare space after the items have been laid out, and share it out evenly between the items so there will be an equal amount of space between each item. To cause an equal amount of space on the right and left (or top and bottom for columns) of each item use the value\nspace-around\n. With\nspace-around\n, items have a half-size space on either end. Or, to cause items to have equal space around them use the value\nspace-evenly\n. With\nspace-evenly\n, items have a full-size space on either end.\nTry the following values of\njustify-content\nin the live sample:\nstart\nend\nleft\nright\nnormal\nflex-start\nflex-end\ncenter\nspace-around\nspace-between\nspace-evenly\nstretch\nhtml\n<div class=\"box\">\n  <div>One</div>\n  <div>Two</div>\n  <div>Three</div>\n</div>\ncss\n.box > * {\n  border: 2px solid rgb(96 139 168);\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  background-color: rgb(96 139 168 / 0.2);\n}\n\n.box {\n  border: 2px dotted rgb(96 139 168);\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: flex-start;\n}\nThe article\nAligning items in a flex container\nexplores these properties in more depth, in order to have a better understanding of how they work. These basic examples, however, are useful in the majority of use cases.\njustify-items\nThe\njustify-items\nproperty is ignored in flexbox layouts.\nplace-items and place-content\nThe\nplace-items\nproperty is a shorthand property for\nalign-items\nand\njustify-items\n. If set on a flex container, it will set the alignment but not the justification, as\njustify-items\nis ignored in flexbox.\nThere is another shorthand property,\nplace-content\n, that defines the\nalign-content\nand\njustify-content\nproperties. The\nalign-content\nproperty only affects flex containers that wrap, and is discussed in\nAligning items in a flex container\n.\nNext steps\nAfter reading this article you should have an understanding of the basic features of flexbox.

This article gives an outline of the main features of flexbox, which we will explore in more detail in the rest of these guides.\n\nWhen we describe flexbox as being one-dimensional we are describing the fact that flexbox deals with layout in one dimension at a time \u00e2\u0080\u0094 either as a row or as a column. This can be contrasted with the two-dimensional model of [CSS Grid Layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Grid_layout), which controls columns and rows together.\n\n## [The two axes of flexbox](#the_two_axes_of_flexbox)\n\nWhen working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the *main axis* and the *cross axis*. The [main axis](#the_main_axis) is defined by the [`flex-direction`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/flex-direction) property, and the [cross axis](#the_cross_axis) runs perpendicular to it. Everything we do with flexbox refers back to these axes, so it is worth understanding how they work from the outset.\n\n### [The main axis](#the_main_axis)\n\nThe [main axis](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Main_Axis) is defined by `flex-direction`, which has four possible values:\n\n- `row`\n- `row-reverse`\n- `column`\n- `column-reverse`\n\nShould you choose `row` or `row-reverse`, your main axis will run along the row in the **inline direction**.\n\n![If flex-direction is set to row the main axis runs along the row in the inline direction.](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts/basics1.svg)\n\nChoose `column` or `column-reverse` and your main axis will run in the **block direction**, from the top of the page to the bottom.\n\n![If flex-direction is set to column the main axis runs in the block direction.](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts/basics2.svg)\n\n### [The cross axis](#the_cross_axis)\n\nThe [cross axis](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross_Axis) runs perpendicular to the main axis. Therefore, if your `flex-direction` (main axis) is set to `row` or `row-reverse` the cross axis runs down the columns.\n\n![If flex-direction is set to row then the cross axis runs in the block direction.](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts/basics3.svg)\n\nIf your main axis is `column` or `column-reverse` then the cross axis runs along the rows.\n\n![If flex-direction is set to column then the cross axis runs in the inline direction.](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts/basics4.svg)\n\n## [Start and end lines](#start_and_end_lines)\n\nAnother vital area of understanding is how flexbox makes no assumption about the writing mode of the document. Flexbox doesn't just assume that all lines of text start at the top left of a document and run towards the right-hand side, with new lines appearing one under the other. Rather, it supports all writing modes, like other [logical properties and values](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Logical_properties_and_values).\n\nYou can [read more about the relationship between flexbox and writing modes](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Flexible_box_layout/Relationship_with_other_layout_methods#writing_modes) in a later article; however, the following description should help explain why we do not talk about left and right and top and bottom when we describe the direction that our flex items flow in.\n\nIf the `flex-direction` is `row` and I am working in English, then the start edge of the main axis will be on the left, the end edge on the right.\n\n![Working in English the start edge is on the left.](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts/basics5.svg)\n\nIf I were to work in Arabic, then the start edge of my main axis would be on the right and the end edge on the left.\n\n![The start edge in a RTL language is on the right.](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts/basics6.svg)\n\nIn both cases the start edge of the cross-axis is at the top of the flex container and the end edge at the bottom, as both languages have a horizontal writing mode.\n\nAfter a while, thinking about start and end rather than left and right becomes natural, and will be useful to you when dealing with other layout methods such as CSS Grid Layout which follow the same patterns.\n\n## [The flex container](#the_flex_container)\n\nAn area of a document that is laid out using flexbox is called a **flex container**. To create a [flex container](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Flex_Container), set the area's [`display`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/display) property to `flex`. When we do this, the direct children of that container become **flex items**. You can explicitly control whether the container itself is displayed inline or in block formatting context using `inline flex` or `inline-flex` for inline flex containers or `block flex` or `flex` for block level flex containers.\n\n### [Initial values](#initial_values)\n\nAs with all properties in CSS, some initial values are defined, so the contents of a new flex container will behave in the following way:\n\n- Items display in a row (the [`flex-direction`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/flex-direction) property's default value is `row`).\n- The items start from the start edge of the main axis.\n- The items do not stretch on the main dimension but can shrink (a flex-item's [`flex-grow`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/flex-grow) property's default value is `0` and its [`flex-shrink`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/flex-shrink) property's default value is `1`).\n- The items will stretch to fill the size of the cross-axis (the [`align-items`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/align-items) property's default value is `stretch`).\n- The flex-item's [`flex-basis`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/flex-basis) property's default value is `auto`. This means that, in each case, it will be equal to the flex item [`width`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/width) in horizontal writing mode, and the flex item [`height`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/height) in vertical writing mode. If the corresponding `width`/`height` is also set to `auto`, the `flex-basis` `content` value is used instead.\n- All the items will be in a single row (the [`flex-wrap`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/flex-wrap) property's default value is `nowrap`), overflowing their container if their combined `width`/`height` exceeds the containing element `width`/`height`.\n\nThe result of this is that your items will all line up in a row, using the size of the content as their size in the main axis. If there are more items than can fit in the container, they will not wrap but will instead overflow. If some items are taller than others, all items will stretch along the full length of the cross-axis.\n\nYou can see in the live sample below how this looks. Click \"Play\" to open the example in the MDN Playground and edit the items or add new items to try out the initial behavior of flexbox:\n\nhtml\n\n```\n<div class=\"box\">\n  <div>One</div>\n  <div>Two</div>\n  <div>Three <br />has <br />extra <br />text</div>\n</div>\n```\n\ncss\n\n```\n.box > * {\n  border: 2px solid rgb(96 139 168);\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  background-color: rgb(96 139 168 / 0.2);\n}\n\n.box {\n  border: 2px dotted rgb(96 139 168);\n  display: flex;\n}\n```\n\n### [Changing flex-direction](#changing_flex-direction)\n\nAdding the [`flex-direction`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/flex-direction) property to the flex container allows us to change the direction in which our flex items display. Setting `flex-direction: row-reverse` will keep the items displaying along the row, however the start and end lines are switched.\n\nIf we change `flex-direction` to `column` the main axis switches and our items now display in a column. Set `column-reverse` and the start and end lines are again switched.\n\nThe live sample below has `flex-direction` set to `row-reverse`. Try the other values \u00e2\u0080\u0094 `row`, `column` and `column-reverse` \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to see what happens to the content.\n\nhtml\n\n```\n<div class=\"box\">\n  <div>One</div>\n  <div>Two</div>\n  <div>Three</div>\n</div>\n```\n\ncss\n\n```\n.box > * {\n  border: 2px solid rgb(96 139 168);\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  background-color: rgb(96 139 168 / 0.2);\n}\n\n.box {\n  border: 2px dotted rgb(96 139 168);\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: row-reverse;\n}\n```\n\n## [Multi-line flex containers with flex-wrap](#multi-line_flex_containers_with_flex-wrap)\n\nWhile flexbox is a one dimensional model, it is possible to make flex items wrap across multiple lines. If you do this, you should consider each line as a new flex container. Any space distribution will happen across each line, without reference to the previous or subsequent lines.\n\nTo cause wrapping behavior add the property [`flex-wrap`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/flex-wrap) with a value of `wrap`. Now, if your items are too large to all display in one line, they will wrap onto another line. The live sample below contains items that have been given a `width`. The total width of the items is too wide for the flex container. As `flex-wrap` is set to `wrap`, the items wrap across multiple lines. If you set it to `nowrap`, which is the initial value, they will shrink to fit the container. They shrink because they are using initial flexbox values, including `flex-shrink: 1`, that allows items to shrink. Using `nowrap` would cause an [overflow](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Overflow) if the items were not able to shrink, or could not shrink small enough to fit.\n\nhtml\n\n```\n<div class=\"box\">\n  <div>One</div>\n  <div>Two</div>\n  <div>Three</div>\n</div>\n```\n\ncss\n\n```\n.box > * {\n  border: 2px solid rgb(96 139 168);\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  background-color: rgb(96 139 168 / 0.2);\n  width: 200px;\n}\n\n.box {\n  width: 500px;\n  border: 2px dotted rgb(96 139 168);\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n}\n```\n\nFind out more about wrapping flex items in the guide [Mastering wrapping of flex items](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Flexible_box_layout/Wrapping_items).\n\n## [The flex-flow shorthand](#the_flex-flow_shorthand)\n\nYou can combine the two properties `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap` into the [`flex-flow`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/flex-flow) shorthand.\n\nIn the live sample below, try changing the first value to one of the allowable values for `flex-direction` - `row`, `row-reverse`, `column` or `column-reverse`, and also change the second to `wrap` and `nowrap`.\n\nhtml\n\n```\n<div class=\"box\">\n  <div>One</div>\n  <div>Two</div>\n  <div>Three</div>\n</div>\n```\n\ncss\n\n```\n.box > * {\n  border: 2px solid rgb(96 139 168);\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  background-color: rgb(96 139 168 / 0.2);\n  width: 200px;\n}\n\n.box {\n  width: 500px;\n  border: 2px dotted rgb(96 139 168);\n  display: flex;\n  flex-flow: row wrap;\n}\n```\n\n## [Properties applied to flex items](#properties_applied_to_flex_items)\n\nTo control the inline-size of each flex item, we target them directly via three properties:\n\n- [`flex-grow`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/flex-grow)\n- [`flex-shrink`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/flex-shrink)\n- [`flex-basis`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/flex-basis)\n\nWe will take a brief look at these properties below, but if you want more comprehensive information, take a look at the [Controlling ratios of flex items on the main axis](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Flexible_box_layout/Controlling_flex_item_ratios) guide.\n\nBefore we can make sense of these properties we need to consider the concept of **available space**. What we are doing when we change the value of these flex properties is to change the way that available space is distributed amongst our items. This concept of available space is also important when we come to look at aligning items.\n\nIf we have three 100 pixel-wide items in a container which is 500 pixels wide, then the space we need to lay out our items is 300 pixels. This leaves 200 pixels of available space. If we don't change the initial values then flexbox will put that space after the last item.\n\n![This flex container has available space after laying out the items.](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts/basics7.svg)\n\nIf we instead would like the items to grow and fill the space, then we need to have a method of distributing the leftover space between the items. The `flex` properties that we apply to the items themselves, enable dictating how that available space should be distributed among the sibling flex items.\n\n### [The flex-basis property](#the_flex-basis_property)\n\nThe `flex-basis` is what defines the size of that item in terms of the space it leaves as available space. The initial value of this property is `auto` \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in this case the browser looks to see if the item has a size. In the example above, all of the items have a width of 100 pixels. This is used as the `flex-basis`.\n\nIf the items don't have a size then the content's size is used as the flex-basis. This is why when we just declare `display: flex` on the parent to create flex items, the items all move into a row and take only as much space as they need to display their contents.\n\n### [The flex-grow property](#the_flex-grow_property)\n\nWith the `flex-grow` property set to a positive integer, if there is available space, the flex item can grow along the main axis from its `flex-basis`. Whether the item stretches to take up all the available space on that axis, or just a portion of the available space depends on if the other items are allowed to grow too and the value of their `flex-grow` properties.\n\nEach item with a positive value consumes a portion of any available space based on their `flex-grow` value. If we gave all of our items in the example above a `flex-grow` value of 1 then the available space in the flex container would be equally shared between our items and they would stretch to fill the container on the main axis. If we give our first item a `flex-grow` value of 2, and the other items a value of 1 each, there are a total of 4 parts; 2 parts of the available space will be given to the first item (100px out of 200px in the case of the example above) and 1 part each the other two (50px each out of the 200px total).\n\n### [The flex-shrink property](#the_flex-shrink_property)\n\nWhere the `flex-grow` property deals with adding space in the main axis, the `flex-shrink` property controls how it is taken away. If we do not have enough space in the container to lay out our items, and `flex-shrink` is set to a positive integer, then the item can become smaller than the `flex-basis`. As with `flex-grow`, different values can be assigned in order to cause one item to shrink faster than others \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an item with a higher value set for `flex-shrink` will shrink faster than its siblings that have lower values.\n\nAn item can shrink down to its [`min-content`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/min-content) size. This minimum size is taken into account while working out the actual amount of shrinkage that will happen, which means that `flex-shrink` has the potential to appear less consistent than `flex-grow` in behavior. We'll therefore take a more detailed look at how this algorithm works in the article [Controlling ratios of items along the main axis](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Flexible_box_layout/Controlling_flex_item_ratios).\n\n**Note:**\nThese values for `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` are proportions. Typically if we had all of our items set to `flex: 1 1 200px` and then wanted one item to grow at twice the rate, we would set that item to `flex: 2 1 200px`. However you could also use `flex: 10 1 200px` and `flex: 20 1 200px` if you wanted.\n\n### [Shorthand values for the flex properties](#shorthand_values_for_the_flex_properties)\n\nYou will very rarely see the `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` properties used individually; instead they are combined into the [`flex`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/flex) shorthand. The `flex` shorthand allows you to set the three values in this order \u00e2\u0080\u0094 `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, `flex-basis`.\n\nThe live sample below allows you to test out the different values of the flex shorthand; remember that the first value is `flex-grow`. Giving this a positive value means the item can grow. The second is `flex-shrink` \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with a positive value the items can shrink, but only if their total values overflow the main axis. The final value is `flex-basis`; this is the value the items are using as their base value to grow and shrink from.\n\nhtml\n\n```\n<div class=\"box\">\n  <div class=\"one\">One</div>\n  <div class=\"two\">Two</div>\n  <div class=\"three\">Three</div>\n</div>\n```\n\ncss\n\n```\n.box > * {\n  border: 2px solid rgb(96 139 168);\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  background-color: rgb(96 139 168 / 0.2);\n}\n\n.box {\n  border: 2px dotted rgb(96 139 168);\n  display: flex;\n}\n\n.one {\n  flex: 1 1 auto;\n}\n\n.two {\n  flex: 1 1 auto;\n}\n\n.three {\n  flex: 1 1 auto;\n}\n```\n\nThere are also some predefined shorthand values which cover most of the use cases. You will often see these used in tutorials, and in many cases these are all you will need to use. The predefined values are as follows:\n\n- `flex: initial`\n- `flex: auto`\n- `flex: none`\n- `flex: <positive-number>`\n\nThe `initial` value is a [CSS-wide keyword](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/Data_types#css-wide_keywords) that represents the initial value for a property. Setting `flex: initial` resets the item to the [initial values](#initial_values) of the three longhand properties, which is the same as `flex: 0 1 auto`. The initial value of `flex-grow` is `0`, so items will not grow larger than their `flex-basis` size. The initial value of `flex-shrink` is `1`, so items can shrink if they need to rather than overflowing. The initial value of `flex-basis` is `auto`. Items will either use any size set on the item in the main dimension, or they will get their size from the content size.\n\nUsing `flex: auto` is the same as using `flex: 1 1 auto`; this is similar to `flex: initial`, except that the items can grow and fill the container as well as shrink if needed.\n\nUsing `flex: none` will create fully inflexible flex items. It is as if you wrote `flex: 0 0 auto`. The items cannot grow or shrink and will be laid out using flexbox with a `flex-basis` of `auto`.\n\nThe shorthand you often see in tutorials is `flex: 1` or `flex: 2` and so on. This is the same as writing `flex: 1 1 0` or `flex: 2 1 0` and so on, respectively. The items get minimum size due to `flex-basis: 0` and then proportionally grow to fill the available space. In this case, the `flex-shrink` value of `1` is redundant because the items start with minimum size \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they're not given any size that could cause them to overflow the flex container.\n\nTry these shorthand values in the live sample below.\n\nhtml\n\n```\n<div class=\"box\">\n  <div class=\"one\">One</div>\n  <div class=\"two\">Two</div>\n  <div class=\"three\">Three</div>\n</div>\n```\n\ncss\n\n```\n.box > * {\n  border: 2px solid rgb(96 139 168);\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  background-color: rgb(96 139 168 / 0.2);\n}\n\n.box {\n  border: 2px dotted rgb(96 139 168);\n  display: flex;\n}\n\n.one {\n  flex: 1;\n}\n\n.two {\n  flex: 1;\n}\n\n.three {\n  flex: 1;\n}\n```\n\n## [Alignment, justification and distribution of free space between items](#alignment_justification_and_distribution_of_free_space_between_items)\n\nA key feature of flexbox is the ability to align and justify items on the main- and cross-axes, and to distribute space between flex items. Note that these properties are set on the flex container, not on the items themselves.\n\n### [align-items](#align-items)\n\nThe [`align-items`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/align-items) property aligns all the flex items on the cross axis.\n\nThe initial value for this property is `stretch` and is why flex items stretch to the height of the flex container by default (or the width if `flex-direction` is set to `column` or `column-reverse`). This height may come from the tallest item in the container or the size set on the flex container itself.\n\nYou could instead set `align-items` to `flex-start`, or simply `start`, in order to make the items line up at the start of the flex container, `flex-end`, or just `end`, to align them to the end, or `center` to align them in the center. Try this in the live sample \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I have given the flex container a height in order that you can see how the items can be moved around inside the container. See what happens if you set the value of align-items to:\n\n- `stretch`\n- `flex-start`\n- `flex-end`\n- `start`\n- `end`\n- `center`\n- `baseline`\n- `last baseline`\n\nhtml\n\n```\n<div class=\"box\">\n  <div>One</div>\n  <div>Two</div>\n  <div>Three <br />has <br />extra <br />text</div>\n</div>\n```\n\ncss\n\n```\n.box > * {\n  border: 2px solid rgb(96 139 168);\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  background-color: rgb(96 139 168 / 0.2);\n}\n\n.box {\n  width: 500px;\n  height: 130px;\n  border: 2px dotted rgb(96 139 168);\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: flex-start;\n}\n```\n\nThe `align-items` is set on the flex container and impacts all the flex items. If you want to align a flex item differently from others, you can set the [`align-self`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/align-self) on the flex item.\n\n### [justify-content](#justify-content)\n\nThe [`justify-content`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/justify-content) property is used to align the items on the main axis, the direction in which `flex-direction` has set the flow. The initial value is `flex-start` which will line the items up at the start edge of the container, but you could also set the value to `flex-end` to line them up at the end, or `center` to line them up in the center.\n\nYou can also use the value `space-between` to take all the spare space after the items have been laid out, and share it out evenly between the items so there will be an equal amount of space between each item. To cause an equal amount of space on the right and left (or top and bottom for columns) of each item use the value `space-around`. With `space-around`, items have a half-size space on either end. Or, to cause items to have equal space around them use the value `space-evenly`. With `space-evenly`, items have a full-size space on either end.\n\nTry the following values of `justify-content` in the live sample:\n\n- `start`\n- `end`\n- `left`\n- `right`\n- `normal`\n- `flex-start`\n- `flex-end`\n- `center`\n- `space-around`\n- `space-between`\n- `space-evenly`\n- `stretch`\n\nhtml\n\n```\n<div class=\"box\">\n  <div>One</div>\n  <div>Two</div>\n  <div>Three</div>\n</div>\n```\n\ncss\n\n```\n.box > * {\n  border: 2px solid rgb(96 139 168);\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  background-color: rgb(96 139 168 / 0.2);\n}\n\n.box {\n  border: 2px dotted rgb(96 139 168);\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: flex-start;\n}\n```\n\nThe article [Aligning items in a flex container](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Flexible_box_layout/Aligning_items) explores these properties in more depth, in order to have a better understanding of how they work. These basic examples, however, are useful in the majority of use cases.\n\n### [justify-items](#justify-items)\n\nThe [`justify-items`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/justify-items) property is ignored in flexbox layouts.\n\n### [place-items and place-content](#place-items_and_place-content)\n\nThe [`place-items`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/place-items) property is a shorthand property for `align-items` and `justify-items`. If set on a flex container, it will set the alignment but not the justification, as `justify-items` is ignored in flexbox.\n\nThere is another shorthand property, [`place-content`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/place-content), that defines the [`align-content`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/align-content) and `justify-content` properties. The `align-content` property only affects flex containers that wrap, and is discussed in [Aligning items in a flex container](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Flexible_box_layout/Aligning_items).\n\n## [Next steps](#next_steps)\n\nAfter reading this article you should have an understanding of the basic features of flexbox. In the next article, we will look at [how this specification relates to other parts of CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Flexible_box_layout/Relationship_with_other_layout_methods).\n\n## Help improve MDN\n\nWas this page helpful to you?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\n[Learn how to contribute](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Getting_started)\n\nThis page was last modified on Dec 5, 2025 by [MDN contributors](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts/contributors.txt).\n\n[View this page on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/css/guides/flexible_box_layout/basic_concepts/index.md?plain=1 \"Folder: en-us/web/css/guides/flexible_box_layout/basic_concepts (Opens in a new tab)\") \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 [Report a problem with this content](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/new?template=page-report.yml&mdn-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FCSS%2FGuides%2FFlexible_box_layout%2FBasic_concepts&metadata=%3C%21--+Do+not+make+changes+below+this+line+--%3E%0A%3Cdetails%3E%0A%3Csummary%3EPage+report+details%3C%2Fsummary%3E%0A%0A*+Folder%3A+%60en-us%2Fweb%2Fcss%2Fguides%2Fflexible_box_layout%2Fbasic_concepts%60%0A*+MDN+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FCSS%2FGuides%2FFlexible_box_layout%2FBasic_concepts%0A*+GitHub+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Ffiles%2Fen-us%2Fweb%2Fcss%2Fguides%2Fflexible_box_layout%2Fbasic_concepts%2Findex.md%0A*+Last+commit%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fcommit%2F1dbba9f7a2c2e35c6e01e8a63159e2aac64b601b%0A*+Document+last+modified%3A+2025-12-05T16%3A09%3A35.000Z%0A%0A%3C%2Fdetails%3E \"This will take you to GitHub to file a new issue.\")",
