To target more specific attributes, use\nmedia features\ninstead.\nTargeting media features\nMedia features describe the specific characteristics of a given\nuser agent\n, output device, or environment.\nFor instance, you can apply specific styles to widescreen monitors, computers that use mice, or devices that are being used in low-light conditions.\nThis example applies styles when the user's\nprimary\ninput mechanism (such as a mouse) can hover over elements:\ncss\n@media (hover: hover) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\nMedia features are either range or discrete.\nDiscrete features\ntake their value from an\nenumerated\nset of possible keyword values. For example, the discrete\norientation\nfeature accepts either\nlandscape\nor\nportrait\n.\ncss\n@media print and (orientation: portrait) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\nMany\nrange features\ncan be prefixed with \"min-\" or \"max-\" to express \"minimum condition\" or \"maximum condition\" constraints.\nFor example, this CSS will apply styles only if your browser's\nviewport\nwidth is equal to or narrower than 1250px:\ncss\n@media (max-width: 1250px) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\nThe following media queries are equivalent to the above example:\ncss\n@media (width <= 1250px) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n\n@media (1250px >= width) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\nWith media query range features, you can either use the inclusive\nmin-\nand\nmax-\nprefixes or the more concise range syntax operators\n<=\nand\n>=\n.\nThe following media queries are equivalent:\ncss\n@media (min-width: 30em) and (max-width: 50em) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n\n@media (30em <= width <= 50em) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n\n@media (50em >= width >= 30em) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\nThe range comparisons above are inclusive. To exclude the comparison value, use\n<\nand/or\n>\n.\ncss\n@media (30em < width < 50em) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n\n@media (50em > width > 30em) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\nIf you create a media feature query without specifying a value, the nested styles will be used as long as the feature's value is not\n0\nor\nnone\n.\nFor example, this CSS will apply to any device with a color screen:\ncss\n@media (color) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\nIf a feature doesn't apply to the device on which the browser is running, expressions involving that media feature are always false.\nFor more\nMedia feature\nexamples, please see the reference page for each specific feature.\nCreating complex media queries\nSometimes you may want to create a media query that depends on multiple conditions. This is where the\nlogical operators\ncome in:\nnot\n,\nand\n, and\nonly\n.\nFurthermore, you can combine multiple media queries into a comma-separated list; this allows you to apply the same styles in different situations, with the contained media queries evaluated as a logical\nor\ncomposition: interpreted as if each media query were within parentheses with an\nor\nbetween them.\nIn the previous example, we saw the\nand\noperator used to group a media\ntype\nwith a media\nfeature\n.\nThe\nand\noperator can also combine multiple media features within a single media query.\nThe\nnot\noperator negates a media query, or a media feature when used with brackets, basically reversing their normal meanings.\nThe\nor\noperator can, under certain conditions, be used to combine multiple media features within a single media query.\nLastly, the\nonly\noperator was used to prevent older browsers from applying the styles without evaluating the media feature expressions but it has no effect in modern browsers.\nNote:\nIn most cases, the\nall\nmedia type is used by default when no other type is specified.\nHowever, if you use the\nonly\noperator, you must explicitly specify a media type. You can see\nonly screen\nor\nonly print\nas a whole.\nCombining multiple types or features\nThe\nand\nkeyword combines a media feature with a media type\nor\nother media features.\nThis example combines two media features to restrict styles to landscape-oriented devices with a width of at least 30 ems:\ncss\n@media (width >= 30em) and (orientation: landscape) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\nTo limit the styles to devices with a screen, you can chain the media features to the\nscreen\nmedia type:\ncss\n@media screen and (width >= 30em) and (orientation: landscape) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\nTesting for multiple queries\nYou can use a comma-separated list of media queries to apply styles when the user's device matches any one of various media types, features, or states.\nThe following rule contains two media queries. The block's styles will apply if either the user's device has a height of 680px or more\nor\nif the browser viewport is in portrait mode (the viewport height is greater than the viewport width):\ncss\n@media (height >= 680px), screen and (orientation: portrait) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\nIn this example, if the user is printing to a PDF and the page height is 800px, the media query returns true because the first query component \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which tests whether the viewport has a height of\n680px\nor more \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is true.\nLikewise, if a user is on a smartphone in portrait mode with a viewport height of 480px, the media query returns true because the second query component is true.\nIn a comma-separated list of media queries, the individual media queries end at the comma or, in the case of the last media query in the list, at the opening bracket (\n{\n).\nInverting a query's meaning\nThe\nnot\nkeyword inverts the meaning of a single media query. For example, the CSS styles in this media query will apply to everything\nexcept\nprinted media:\ncss\n@media not print {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\nThe\nnot\nnegates only the media query it is applied to. The\nnot\n, without parenthesis, negates all the features within the media query in which it is contained. This means, in a comma-separated list of media queries, each\nnot\napplies to the single query it is contained within, applying to\nall\nthe features within that single query. In this example, the\nnot\napplies to the first media query\nscreen and (color)\n, which concludes at the first comma:\ncss\n@media not screen and (color), print and (color) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\nBecause the query starts with a media type\nscreen\n, you\ncannot\nwrap\nscreen and (color)\nwith parentheses. On the other hand, if your media query consists of features only, then you\nmust\nparenthesize the query:\ncss\n@media not ((width > 1000px) and (color)), print and (color) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\nParentheses limit the components of the query that get negated. For example, to negate the\n(width > 1000px)\nquery only:\ncss\n@media (not (width > 1000px)) and (color), print and (color) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\nnot\nonly negates the query to its right. In this example, we negate the\nhover\nmedia feature but not the\nscreen\nmedia type:\ncss\n@media screen and not (hover) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\nThe\nnot (hover)\nmatches if the device has no hover capability. In this case, because of its ordering, the\nnot\napplies to\nhover\nbut not to\nscreen\n.\nImproving compatibility with older browsers\nThe\nonly\nkeyword prevents older browsers that do not support media queries with media features from applying the given styles.\nIt has no effect on modern browsers.\ncss\n@media only screen and (color) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\nTesting for multiple features with\nor\nYou can use\nor\nto test for a match among more than one feature, resolving to\ntrue\nif any of the features are true.\nFor example, the following query tests for devices that have a monochrome display or hover capability:\ncss\n@media (not (color)) or (hover) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\nNote that you cannot use the\nor\noperator on the same level as the\nand\nand\nnot\noperators. You can either separate the media features with a comma or use parenthesis to group sub-expressions of media features to clarify the order of evaluation.\nFor example, the following queries are both valid:\ncss\n@media ((color) and (hover)) or (monochrome) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n\n/* or */\n@media (color) and (hover), (monochrome) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\nSee also\n@media\nContainer queries\nTesting media queries programmatically\nCSS Animations Between Media Queries\nExtended Mozilla media features\nExtended WebKit media features\nHelp improve MDN\nLearn how to contribute\nThis page was last modified on\nDec 2, 2025\nby\nMDN contributors\n.\nView this page on GitHub\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\nReport a problem with this content",

To target more specific attributes, use *media features* instead.\n\n## [Targeting media features](#targeting_media_features)\n\nMedia features describe the specific characteristics of a given [user agent](/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent), output device, or environment.\nFor instance, you can apply specific styles to widescreen monitors, computers that use mice, or devices that are being used in low-light conditions.\nThis example applies styles when the user's *primary* input mechanism (such as a mouse) can hover over elements:\n\ncss\n\n```\n@media (hover: hover) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n```\n\nMedia features are either range or discrete.\n\n*Discrete features* take their value from an [enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated) set of possible keyword values. For example, the discrete `orientation` feature accepts either `landscape` or `portrait`.\n\ncss\n\n```\n@media print and (orientation: portrait) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n```\n\nMany *range features* can be prefixed with \"min-\" or \"max-\" to express \"minimum condition\" or \"maximum condition\" constraints.\nFor example, this CSS will apply styles only if your browser's [viewport](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Viewport) width is equal to or narrower than 1250px:\n\ncss\n\n```\n@media (max-width: 1250px) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n```\n\nThe following media queries are equivalent to the above example:\n\ncss\n\n```\n@media (width <= 1250px) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n\n@media (1250px >= width) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n```\n\nWith media query range features, you can either use the inclusive `min-` and `max-` prefixes or the more concise range syntax operators `<=` and `>=`.\n\nThe following media queries are equivalent:\n\ncss\n\n```\n@media (min-width: 30em) and (max-width: 50em) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n\n@media (30em <= width <= 50em) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n\n@media (50em >= width >= 30em) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n```\n\nThe range comparisons above are inclusive. To exclude the comparison value, use `<` and/or `>`.\n\ncss\n\n```\n@media (30em < width < 50em) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n\n@media (50em > width > 30em) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n```\n\nIf you create a media feature query without specifying a value, the nested styles will be used as long as the feature's value is not `0` or `none`.\nFor example, this CSS will apply to any device with a color screen:\n\ncss\n\n```\n@media (color) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n```\n\nIf a feature doesn't apply to the device on which the browser is running, expressions involving that media feature are always false.\n\nFor more [Media feature](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@media#media_features) examples, please see the reference page for each specific feature.\n\n## [Creating complex media queries](#creating_complex_media_queries)\n\nSometimes you may want to create a media query that depends on multiple conditions. This is where the *logical operators* come in: `not`, `and`, and `only`.\nFurthermore, you can combine multiple media queries into a comma-separated list; this allows you to apply the same styles in different situations, with the contained media queries evaluated as a logical `or` composition: interpreted as if each media query were within parentheses with an `or` between them.\n\nIn the previous example, we saw the `and` operator used to group a media *type* with a media *feature*.\nThe `and` operator can also combine multiple media features within a single media query.\nThe `not` operator negates a media query, or a media feature when used with brackets, basically reversing their normal meanings.\nThe `or` operator can, under certain conditions, be used to combine multiple media features within a single media query.\nLastly, the `only` operator was used to prevent older browsers from applying the styles without evaluating the media feature expressions but it has no effect in modern browsers.\n\n**Note:**\nIn most cases, the `all` media type is used by default when no other type is specified.\nHowever, if you use the `only` operator, you must explicitly specify a media type. You can see `only screen` or `only print` as a whole.\n\n### [Combining multiple types or features](#combining_multiple_types_or_features)\n\nThe `and` keyword combines a media feature with a media type *or* other media features.\nThis example combines two media features to restrict styles to landscape-oriented devices with a width of at least 30 ems:\n\ncss\n\n```\n@media (width >= 30em) and (orientation: landscape) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n```\n\nTo limit the styles to devices with a screen, you can chain the media features to the `screen` media type:\n\ncss\n\n```\n@media screen and (width >= 30em) and (orientation: landscape) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n```\n\n### [Testing for multiple queries](#testing_for_multiple_queries)\n\nYou can use a comma-separated list of media queries to apply styles when the user's device matches any one of various media types, features, or states.\n\nThe following rule contains two media queries. The block's styles will apply if either the user's device has a height of 680px or more *or* if the browser viewport is in portrait mode (the viewport height is greater than the viewport width):\n\ncss\n\n```\n@media (height >= 680px), screen and (orientation: portrait) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, if the user is printing to a PDF and the page height is 800px, the media query returns true because the first query component \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which tests whether the viewport has a height of `680px` or more \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is true.\nLikewise, if a user is on a smartphone in portrait mode with a viewport height of 480px, the media query returns true because the second query component is true.\n\nIn a comma-separated list of media queries, the individual media queries end at the comma or, in the case of the last media query in the list, at the opening bracket (`{`).\n\n### [Inverting a query's meaning](#inverting_a_querys_meaning)\n\nThe `not` keyword inverts the meaning of a single media query. For example, the CSS styles in this media query will apply to everything *except* printed media:\n\ncss\n\n```\n@media not print {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n```\n\nThe `not` negates only the media query it is applied to. The `not`, without parenthesis, negates all the features within the media query in which it is contained. This means, in a comma-separated list of media queries, each `not` applies to the single query it is contained within, applying to *all* the features within that single query. In this example, the `not` applies to the first media query `screen and (color)`, which concludes at the first comma:\n\ncss\n\n```\n@media not screen and (color), print and (color) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n```\n\nBecause the query starts with a media type `screen`, you *cannot* wrap `screen and (color)` with parentheses. On the other hand, if your media query consists of features only, then you *must* parenthesize the query:\n\ncss\n\n```\n@media not ((width > 1000px) and (color)), print and (color) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n```\n\nParentheses limit the components of the query that get negated. For example, to negate the `(width > 1000px)` query only:\n\ncss\n\n```\n@media (not (width > 1000px)) and (color), print and (color) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n```\n\n`not` only negates the query to its right. In this example, we negate the `hover` media feature but not the `screen` media type:\n\ncss\n\n```\n@media screen and not (hover) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n```\n\nThe `not (hover)` matches if the device has no hover capability. In this case, because of its ordering, the `not` applies to `hover` but not to `screen`.\n\n### [Improving compatibility with older browsers](#improving_compatibility_with_older_browsers)\n\nThe `only` keyword prevents older browsers that do not support media queries with media features from applying the given styles.\n*It has no effect on modern browsers.*\n\ncss\n\n```\n@media only screen and (color) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n```\n\n### [Testing for multiple features with `or`](#testing_for_multiple_features_with_or)\n\nYou can use `or` to test for a match among more than one feature, resolving to `true` if any of the features are true.\nFor example, the following query tests for devices that have a monochrome display or hover capability:\n\ncss\n\n```\n@media (not (color)) or (hover) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n```\n\nNote that you cannot use the `or` operator on the same level as the `and` and `not` operators. You can either separate the media features with a comma or use parenthesis to group sub-expressions of media features to clarify the order of evaluation.\n\nFor example, the following queries are both valid:\n\ncss\n\n```\n@media ((color) and (hover)) or (monochrome) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n\n/* or */\n@media (color) and (hover), (monochrome) {\n  /* \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 */\n}\n```\n\n## [See also](#see_also)\n\n- [@media](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@media)\n- [Container queries](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Containment/Container_queries)\n- [Testing media queries programmatically](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Media_queries/Testing)\n- [CSS Animations Between Media Queries](https://davidwalsh.name/animate-media-queries)\n- [Extended Mozilla media features](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Mozilla_extensions#media_features)\n- [Extended WebKit media features](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Webkit_extensions#media_features)\n\n## Help improve MDN\n\nWas this page helpful to you?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\n[Learn how to contribute](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Getting_started)\n\nThis page was last modified on Dec 2, 2025 by [MDN contributors](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Media_queries/Using/contributors.txt).\n\n[View this page on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/css/guides/media_queries/using/index.md?plain=1 \"Folder: en-us/web/css/guides/media_queries/using (Opens in a new tab)\") \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 [Report a problem with this content](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/new?template=page-report.yml&mdn-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FCSS%2FGuides%2FMedia_queries%2FUsing&metadata=%3C%21--+Do+not+make+changes+below+this+line+--%3E%0A%3Cdetails%3E%0A%3Csummary%3EPage+report+details%3C%2Fsummary%3E%0A%0A*+Folder%3A+%60en-us%2Fweb%2Fcss%2Fguides%2Fmedia_queries%2Fusing%60%0A*+MDN+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FCSS%2FGuides%2FMedia_queries%2FUsing%0A*+GitHub+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Ffiles%2Fen-us%2Fweb%2Fcss%2Fguides%2Fmedia_queries%2Fusing%2Findex.md%0A*+Last+commit%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fcommit%2F3ee2355c3c90cf92c3119b82f8ebfa5d16c91c53%0A*+Document+last+modified%3A+2025-12-02T16%3A36%3A33.000Z%0A%0A%3C%2Fdetails%3E \"This will take you to GitHub to file a new issue.\")",
