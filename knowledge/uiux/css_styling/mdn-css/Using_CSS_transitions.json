  "content": "Using CSS transitions\nCSS transitions\nprovide a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties. Instead of having property changes take effect immediately, you can cause the changes in a property to take place over a period of time. For example, if you change the color of an element from white to black, usually the change is instantaneous. With CSS transitions enabled, changes occur at time intervals that follow an acceleration curve, all of which can be customized.\nAnimations that involve transitioning between two states are often called\nimplicit transitions\nas the states in between the start and final states are implicitly defined by the browser.\nCSS transitions let you decide which properties to animate (by\nlisting them explicitly\n), when the animation will start (by setting a\ndelay\n), how long the transition will last (by setting a\nduration\n), and how the transition will run (by defining an\neasing function\n, e.g., linearly or quick at the beginning, slow at the end).\nWhich CSS properties can be transitioned?\nThe Web author can define which property has to be animated and in which way. This allows the creation of complex transitions. However, some properties are\nnot animatable\nas it doesn't make sense to animate them.\nNote:\nThe\nauto\nvalue is often a very complex case. The specification recommends not animating from and to\nauto\n. Some user agents, like those based on Gecko, implement this requirement and others, like those based on WebKit, are less strict. Using animations with\nauto\nmay lead to unpredictable results, depending on the browser and its version, and should be avoided.\nDefining transitions\nCSS Transitions are controlled using the shorthand\ntransition\nproperty. This is the best way to configure transitions, as it makes it easier to avoid out of sync parameters, which can be very frustrating to have to spend lots of time debugging in CSS.\nYou can control the individual components of the transition with the following sub-properties:\ntransition-property\nSpecifies the name or names of the CSS properties to which transitions should be applied. Only properties listed here are animated during transitions; changes to all other properties occur instantaneously as usual.\ntransition-duration\nSpecifies the duration over which transitions should occur. You can specify a single duration that applies to all properties during the transition, or multiple values to allow each property to transition over a different period of time.\ntransition-timing-function\nSpecifies a function to define how intermediate values for properties are computed.\nEasing functions\ndetermine how intermediate values of the transition are calculated. Most\neasing functions\ncan be specified by providing the graph of the corresponding function, as defined by four points defining a cubic bezier. You can also choose easing from\nEasing functions cheat sheet\n.\ntransition-delay\nDefines how long to wait between the time a property is changed and the transition actually begins.\nThe\ntransition\nshorthand CSS syntax is written as follows:\ntransition: <property> <duration> <timing-function> <delay>;\nExamples\nBasic example\nThis example performs a four-second font size transition with a two-second delay between the time the user mouses over the element and the beginning of the animation effect:\ncss\n#delay {\n  font-size: 14px;\n  transition-property: font-size;\n  transition-duration: 4s;\n  transition-delay: 2s;\n}\n\n#delay:hover {\n  font-size: 36px;\n}\nMultiple animated properties example\n<body>\n  <p>\n    The box below combines transitions for: width, height, background-color,\n    rotate. Hover over the box to see these properties animated.\n  </p>\n  <div class=\"box\">Sample</div>\n</body>\nCSS\ncss\n.box {\n  border-style: solid;\n  border-width: 1px;\n  display: block;\n  width: 100px;\n  height: 100px;\n  background-color: blue;\n  transition:\n    width 2s,\n    height 2s,\n    background-color 2s,\n    rotate 2s;\n}\n\n.box:hover {\n  background-color: #ffcccc;\n  width: 200px;\n  height: 200px;\n  rotate: 180deg;\n}\nWhen property value lists are of different lengths\nIf any property's list of values is shorter than the others, its values are repeated to make them match. For example:\ncss\ndiv {\n  transition-property: opacity, left, top, height;\n  transition-duration: 3s, 5s;\n}\nThis is treated as if it were:\ncss\ndiv {\n  transition-property: opacity, left, top, height;\n  transition-duration: 3s, 5s, 3s, 5s;\n}\nSimilarly, if any property's value list is longer than that for\ntransition-property\n, it's truncated, so if you have the following CSS:\ncss\ndiv {\n  transition-property: opacity, left;\n  transition-duration: 3s, 5s, 2s, 1s;\n}\nThis gets interpreted as:\ncss\ndiv {\n  transition-property: opacity, left;\n  transition-duration: 3s, 5s;\n}\nUsing transitions when highlighting menus\nA common use of CSS is to highlight items in a menu as the user hovers the mouse cursor over them. It's easy to use transitions to make the effect even more attractive.\nFirst, we set up the menu using HTML:\nhtml\n<nav>\n  <a href=\"#\">Home</a>\n  <a href=\"#\">About</a>\n  <a href=\"#\">Contact Us</a>\n  <a href=\"#\">Links</a>\n</nav>\nThen we build the CSS to implement the look and feel of our menu:\ncss\nnav {\n  display: flex;\n  gap: 0.5rem;\n}\n\na {\n  flex: 1;\n  background-color: #333333;\n  color: white;\n  border: 1px solid;\n  padding: 0.5rem;\n  text-align: center;\n  text-decoration: none;\n  transition: all 0.5s ease-out;\n}\n\na:hover,\na:focus {\n  background-color: white;\n  color: #333333;\n}\nThis CSS establishes the look of the menu, with the background and text colors both changing when the element is in its\n:hover\nand\n:focus\nstates:\nTransitioning display and content-visibility\nThis example demonstrates how\ndisplay\nand\ncontent-visibility\ncan be transitioned. This behavior is useful for creating entry/exit animations where you want to for example remove a container from the DOM with\ndisplay: none\n, but have it fade out with\nopacity\nrather than disappearing immediately.\nSupporting browsers transition\ndisplay\nand\ncontent-visibility\nwith a variation on the\ndiscrete animation type\n. This generally means that properties will flip between two values 50% through animating between the two.\nThere is an exception, however, which is when animating to/from\ndisplay: none\nor\ncontent-visibility: hidden\n. In this case, the browser will flip between the two values so that the transitioned content is shown for the entire animation duration.\nSo for example:\nWhen animating\ndisplay\nfrom\nnone\nto\nblock\n(or another visible\ndisplay\nvalue), the value will flip to\nblock\nat\n0%\nof the animation duration so it is visible throughout.\nWhen animating\ndisplay\nfrom\nblock\n(or another visible\ndisplay\nvalue) to\nnone\n, the value will flip to\nnone\nat\n100%\nof the animation duration so it is visible throughout.\nWhen transitioning these properties\ntransition-behavior: allow-discrete\nneeds to be set on the transitions. This effectively enables\ndisplay\n/\ncontent-visibility\ntransitions.\nWhen transitioning\ndisplay\n,\n@starting-style\nis needed to provide a set of starting values for properties set on an element that you want to transition from when the element receives its first style update. This is needed to avoid unexpected behavior. By default, CSS transitions are not triggered on elements' first style updates when they first appear in the DOM, which includes when\ndisplay\nchanges from\nnone\nto another state.\ncontent-visibility\nanimations do not need starting values specified in a\n@starting-style\nblock. This is because\ncontent-visibility\ndoesn't hide an element from the DOM like\ndisplay\ndoes: it just skips rendering the element's content.\nHTML\nThe HTML contains two\n<p>\nelements with a\n<div>\nin between that we will animate from\ndisplay\nnone\nto\nblock\n.\nhtml\n<p>\n  Click anywhere on the screen or press any key to toggle the\n  <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> between hidden and showing.\n</p>\n\n<div>\n  This is a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element that transitions between\n  <code>display: none; opacity: 0</code> and\n  <code>display: block; opacity: 1</code>. Neat, huh?\n</div>\n\n<p>\n  This is another paragraph to show that <code>display: none;</code> is being\n  applied and removed on the above <code>&lt;div&gt; </code>. If only its\n  <code>opacity</code> was being changed, it would always take up the space in\n  the DOM.\n</p>\nCSS\ncss\nhtml {\n  height: 100vh;\n}\n\ndiv {\n  font-size: 1.6rem;\n  padding: 20px;\n  border: 3px solid red;\n  border-radius: 20px;\n  width: 480px;\n\n  display: none;\n  opacity: 0;\n  transition:\n    opacity 1s,\n    display 1s allow-discrete;\n  /* Equivalent to\n  transition: all 1s allow-discrete; */\n}\n\n.showing {\n  opacity: 1;\n  display: block;\n}\n\n@starting-style {\n  .showing {\n    opacity: 0;\n  }\n}\nNote the\n@starting-style\nblock used to specify the starting style for the transition, and the inclusion of the\ndisplay\nproperty in the transitions list, with\nallow-discrete\nset on it.\nJavaScript\nFinally, we include a bit of JavaScript to set up event listeners to trigger the transition (via the\nshowing\nclass).\njs\nconst divElem = document.querySelector(\"div\");\nconst htmlElem = document.querySelector(\":root\");\n\nhtmlElem.addEventListener(\"click\", showHide);\ndocument.addEventListener(\"keydown\", showHide);\n\nfunction showHide() {\n  divElem.classList.toggle(\"showing\");\n}\nResult\nThe code renders as follows:\nJavaScript examples\nNote:\nCare should be taken when using a transition immediately after:\nadding the element to the DOM using\n.appendChild()\nremoving an element's\ndisplay: none;\nproperty.\nThis is treated as if the initial state had never occurred and the element was always in its final state. One way to overcome this limitation is to apply a\nsetTimeout()\nof a handful of milliseconds before changing the CSS property you intend to transition to.\nUsing transitions to make JavaScript functionality smooth\nTransitions are a great tool to make things look much smoother without having to do anything to your JavaScript functionality. Take the following example.\nhtml\n<p>Click anywhere to move the ball</p>\n<div id=\"foo\" class=\"ball\"></div>\njs\n// Make the ball move to a certain position:\nconst f = document.getElementById(\"foo\");\ndocument.addEventListener(\"click\", (ev) => {\n  f.style.transform = `translateY(${ev.clientY - 25}px)`;\n  f.style.transform += `translateX(${ev.clientX - 25}px)`;\n});\nWith CSS, you can smooth the styles applied through JavaScript. Add a transition to the element and any change will happen smoothly:\nbody {\n  background-color: white;\n  color: #333333;\n  font:\n    1.2em / 1.5 \"Helvetica Neue\",\n    \"Helvetica\",\n    \"Arial\",\n    sans-serif;\n  padding: 0;\n  margin: 0;\n}\n\np {\n  margin-top: 3em;\n}\n\nmain {\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n  max-width: 660px;\n  height: 400px;\n  border: 1px solid #cccccc;\n  padding: 20px;\n}\ncss\n.ball {\n  border-radius: 25px;\n  width: 50px;\n  height: 50px;\n  background: #cc0000;\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  transition: transform 1s;\n}\nDetecting the start and completion of a transition\nYou can use the\ntransitionend\nevent to detect that an animation has finished running. This is a\nTransitionEvent\nobject, which has two added properties beyond a typical\nEvent\nobject:\npropertyName\nA string indicating the name of the CSS property whose transition completed.\nelapsedTime\nA float indicating the number of seconds the transition had been running at the time the event fired. This value isn't affected by the value of\ntransition-delay\n.\nAs usual, you can use the\naddEventListener()\nmethod to monitor for this event:\njs\nel.addEventListener(\"transitionend\", updateTransition);\nYou detect the beginning of a transition using\ntransitionrun\n(fires before any delay) and\ntransitionstart\n(fires after any delay), in the same kind of fashion:\njs\nel.addEventListener(\"transitionrun\", signalStart);\nel.addEventListener(\"transitionstart\", signalStart);\nNote:\nThe\ntransitionend\nevent doesn't fire if the transition is aborted before the transition is completed because either the element is made\ndisplay: none\nor the animating property's value is changed.\nSpecifications\nSpecification\nCSS Transitions Module Level 1\nSee also\nThe\nTransitionEvent\ninterface and the\ntransitionend\nevent\nUsing CSS animations\nHelp improve MDN\nLearn how to contribute\nThis page was last modified on\nDec 16, 2025\nby\nMDN contributors\n.\nView this page on GitHub\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\nReport a problem with this content",

This behavior is useful for creating entry/exit animations where you want to for example remove a container from the DOM with `display: none`, but have it fade out with [`opacity`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/opacity) rather than disappearing immediately.\n\nSupporting browsers transition `display` and `content-visibility` with a variation on the [discrete animation type](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Animations/Animatable_properties#discrete). This generally means that properties will flip between two values 50% through animating between the two.\n\nThere is an exception, however, which is when animating to/from `display: none` or `content-visibility: hidden`. In this case, the browser will flip between the two values so that the transitioned content is shown for the entire animation duration.\n\nSo for example:\n\n- When animating `display` from `none` to `block` (or another visible `display` value), the value will flip to `block` at `0%` of the animation duration so it is visible throughout.\n- When animating `display` from `block` (or another visible `display` value) to `none`, the value will flip to `none` at `100%` of the animation duration so it is visible throughout.\n\nWhen transitioning these properties [`transition-behavior: allow-discrete`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/transition-behavior) needs to be set on the transitions. This effectively enables `display`/`content-visibility` transitions.\n\nWhen transitioning `display`, [`@starting-style`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@starting-style) is needed to provide a set of starting values for properties set on an element that you want to transition from when the element receives its first style update.

One way to overcome this limitation is to apply a `setTimeout()` of a handful of milliseconds before changing the CSS property you intend to transition to.\n\n### [Using transitions to make JavaScript functionality smooth](#using_transitions_to_make_javascript_functionality_smooth)\n\nTransitions are a great tool to make things look much smoother without having to do anything to your JavaScript functionality. Take the following example.\n\nhtml\n\n```\n<p>Click anywhere to move the ball</p>\n<div id=\"foo\" class=\"ball\"></div>\n```\n\njs\n\n```\n// Make the ball move to a certain position:\nconst f = document.getElementById(\"foo\");\ndocument.addEventListener(\"click\", (ev) => {\n  f.style.transform = `translateY(${ev.clientY - 25}px)`;\n  f.style.transform += `translateX(${ev.clientX - 25}px)`;\n});\n```\n\nWith CSS, you can smooth the styles applied through JavaScript. Add a transition to the element and any change will happen smoothly:\n\n```\nbody {\n  background-color: white;\n  color: #333333;\n  font:\n    1.2em / 1.5 \"Helvetica Neue\",\n    \"Helvetica\",\n    \"Arial\",\n    sans-serif;\n  padding: 0;\n  margin: 0;\n}\n\np {\n  margin-top: 3em;\n}\n\nmain {\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n  max-width: 660px;\n  height: 400px;\n  border: 1px solid #cccccc;\n  padding: 20px;\n}\n```\n\ncss\n\n```\n.ball {\n  border-radius: 25px;\n  width: 50px;\n  height: 50px;\n  background: #cc0000;\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  transition: transform 1s;\n}\n```\n\n### [Detecting the start and completion of a transition](#detecting_the_start_and_completion_of_a_transition)\n\nYou can use the [`transitionend`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/transitionend_event \"transitionend\") event to detect that an animation has finished running. This is a [`TransitionEvent`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/TransitionEvent) object, which has two added properties beyond a typical [`Event`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event) object:\n\n[`propertyName`](#propertyname)\n:   A string indicating the name of the CSS property whose transition completed.\n\n[`elapsedTime`](#elapsedtime)\n:   A float indicating the number of seconds the transition had been running at the time the event fired. This value isn't affected by the value of [`transition-delay`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/transition-delay).\n\nAs usual, you can use the [`addEventListener()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener \"addEventListener()\") method to monitor for this event:\n\njs\n\n```\nel.addEventListener(\"transitionend\", updateTransition);\n```\n\nYou detect the beginning of a transition using [`transitionrun`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/transitionrun_event \"transitionrun\") (fires before any delay) and [`transitionstart`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/transitionstart_event \"transitionstart\") (fires after any delay), in the same kind of fashion:\n\njs\n\n```\nel.addEventListener(\"transitionrun\", signalStart);\nel.addEventListener(\"transitionstart\", signalStart);\n```\n\n**Note:**\nThe `transitionend` event doesn't fire if the transition is aborted before the transition is completed because either the element is made [`display: none`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/display) or the animating property's value is changed.\n\n## [Specifications](#specifications)\n\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [CSS Transitions Module Level 1](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transitions/) |\n\n## [See also](#see_also)\n\n- The [`TransitionEvent`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/TransitionEvent) interface and the [`transitionend`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/transitionend_event \"transitionend\") event\n- [Using CSS animations](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Animations/Using)\n\n## Help improve MDN\n\nWas this page helpful to you?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\n[Learn how to contribute](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Getting_started)\n\nThis page was last modified on Dec 16, 2025 by [MDN contributors](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Transitions/Using/contributors.txt).\n\n[View this page on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/css/guides/transitions/using/index.md?plain=1 \"Folder: en-us/web/css/guides/transitions/using (Opens in a new tab)\") \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 [Report a problem with this content](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/new?template=page-report.yml&mdn-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FCSS%2FGuides%2FTransitions%2FUsing&metadata=%3C%21--+Do+not+make+changes+below+this+line+--%3E%0A%3Cdetails%3E%0A%3Csummary%3EPage+report+details%3C%2Fsummary%3E%0A%0A*+Folder%3A+%60en-us%2Fweb%2Fcss%2Fguides%2Ftransitions%2Fusing%60%0A*+MDN+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FCSS%2FGuides%2FTransitions%2FUsing%0A*+GitHub+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Ffiles%2Fen-us%2Fweb%2Fcss%2Fguides%2Ftransitions%2Fusing%2Findex.md%0A*+Last+commit%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fcommit%2F33094d735e90b4dcae5733331b79c51fee997410%0A*+Document+last+modified%3A+2025-12-16T15%3A14%3A26.000Z%0A%0A%3C%2Fdetails%3E \"This will take you to GitHub to file a new issue.\")",
