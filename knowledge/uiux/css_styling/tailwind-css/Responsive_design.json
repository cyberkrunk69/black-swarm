Technically we could have just used\nshrink-0\nsince it would do nothing on smaller screens, but since it only matters on\nmd\nscreens, it's a good idea to make that clear in the class name.\nOn small screens the image is automatically full width by default. On medium screens and up, we've constrained the width to a fixed size and ensured the image is full height using\nmd:h-full md:w-48\n.\nWe've only used one breakpoint in this example, but you could easily customize this component at other sizes using the\nsm\n,\nlg\n,\nxl\n, or\n2xl\nresponsive prefixes as well.\nWorking mobile-first\nTailwind uses a mobile-first breakpoint system, similar to what you might be used to in other frameworks like Bootstrap.\nWhat this means is that unprefixed utilities (like\nuppercase\n) take effect on all screen sizes, while prefixed utilities (like\nmd:uppercase\n) only take effect at the specified breakpoint\nand above\n.\nTargeting mobile screens\nWhere this approach surprises people most often is that to style something for mobile, you need to use the unprefixed version of a utility, not the\nsm:\nprefixed version.
