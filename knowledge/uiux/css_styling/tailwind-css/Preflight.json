By default, browsers assign sizes to headings that don't exist in Tailwind's default type scale, and aren't guaranteed to exist in your own type scale.\nIn UI development, headings should often be visually de-emphasized\n. Making headings unstyled by default means any styling you apply to headings happens consciously and deliberately.\nYou can always add default header styles to your project by\nadding your own base styles\n.\nLists are unstyled\nOrdered and unordered lists are unstyled by default, with no bullets or numbers:\nCSS\nol\n,\nul\n,\nmenu\n{\nlist-style\n:\nnone\n;\n}\nIf you'd like to style a list, you can do so using the\nlist-style-type\nand\nlist-style-position\nutilities:\nHTML\n<\nul\nclass\n=\n\"list-inside list-disc\"\n>\n<\nli\n>\nOne\n</\nli\n>\n<\nli\n>\nTwo\n</\nli\n>\n<\nli\n>\nThree\n</\nli\n>\n</\nul\n>\nYou can always add default list styles to your project by\nadding your own base styles\n.\nAccessibility considerations\nUnstyled lists are\nnot announced as lists by VoiceOver\n.

  "content_markdown": "## [Overview](#overview)\n\nBuilt on top of [modern-normalize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize), Preflight is a set of base styles for Tailwind projects that are designed to smooth over cross-browser inconsistencies and make it easier for you to work within the constraints of your design system.\n\nWhen you import `tailwindcss` into your project, Preflight is automatically injected into the `base` layer:\n\nCSS\n\n```\n@layer theme, base, components, utilities;@import \"tailwindcss/theme.css\" layer(theme);@import \"tailwindcss/preflight.css\" layer(base);@import \"tailwindcss/utilities.css\" layer(utilities);\n```\n\nWhile most of the styles in Preflight are meant to go unnoticed\u2014they simply make things behave more like you'd expect them to\u2014some are more opinionated and can be surprising when you first encounter them.\n\nFor a complete reference of all the styles applied by Preflight, [see the stylesheet](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/main/packages/tailwindcss/preflight.css).\n\n### [Margins are removed](#margins-are-removed)\n\nPreflight removes all of the default margins from all elements including headings, blockquotes, paragraphs, etc:\n\nCSS\n\n```\n*,::after,::before,::backdrop,::file-selector-button {  margin: 0;  padding: 0;}\n```\n\nThis makes it harder to accidentally rely on margin values applied by the user-agent stylesheet that are not part of your spacing scale.\n\n### [Border styles are reset](#border-styles-are-reset)\n\nIn order to make it easy to add a border by simply adding the `border` class, Tailwind overrides the default border styles for all elements with the following rules:\n\nCSS\n\n```\n*,::after,::before,::backdrop,::file-selector-button {  box-sizing: border-box;  border: 0 solid;}\n```\n\nSince the `border` class only sets the `border-width` property, this reset ensures that adding that class always adds a solid `1px` border that uses `currentColor`.\n\nThis can cause some unexpected results when integrating certain third-party libraries, like [Google maps](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/484) for example.\n\nWhen you run into situations like this, you can work around them by overriding the Preflight styles with your own custom CSS:\n\nCSS\n\n```\n@layer base {  .google-map * {    border-style: none;  }}\n```\n\n### [Headings are unstyled](#headings-are-unstyled)\n\nAll heading elements are completely unstyled by default, and have the same font size and weight as normal text:\n\nCSS\n\n```\nh1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 {  font-size: inherit;  font-weight: inherit;}\n```\n\nThe reason for this is two-fold:\n\n- **It helps you avoid accidentally deviating from your type scale**. By default, browsers assign sizes to headings that don't exist in Tailwind's default type scale, and aren't guaranteed to exist in your own type scale.\n- **In UI development, headings should often be visually de-emphasized**. Making headings unstyled by default means any styling you apply to headings happens consciously and deliberately.\n\nYou can always add default header styles to your project by [adding your own base styles](/docs/adding-custom-styles#adding-base-styles).\n\n### [Lists are unstyled](#lists-are-unstyled)\n\nOrdered and unordered lists are unstyled by default, with no bullets or numbers:\n\nCSS\n\n```\nol,ul,menu {  list-style: none;}\n```\n\nIf you'd like to style a list, you can do so using the [list-style-type](/docs/list-style-type) and [list-style-position](/docs/list-style-position) utilities:\n\nHTML\n\n```\n<ul class=\"list-inside list-disc\">  <li>One</li>  <li>Two</li>  <li>Three</li></ul>\n```\n\nYou can always add default list styles to your project by [adding your own base styles](/docs/adding-custom-styles#adding-base-styles).\n\n#### [Accessibility considerations](#accessibility-considerations)\n\nUnstyled lists are [not announced as lists by VoiceOver](https://unfetteredthoughts.net/2017/09/26/voiceover-and-list-style-type-none/). If your content is truly a list but you would like to keep it unstyled, [add a \"list\" role](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/01/12/lists-and-safari.html) to the element:\n\nHTML\n\n```\n<ul role=\"list\">  <li>One</li>  <li>Two</li>  <li>Three</li></ul>\n```\n\n### [Images are block-level](#images-are-block-level)\n\nImages and other replaced elements (like `svg`, `video`, `canvas`, and others) are `display: block` by default:\n\nCSS\n\n```\nimg,svg,video,canvas,audio,iframe,embed,object {  display: block;  vertical-align: middle;}\n```\n\nThis helps to avoid unexpected alignment issues that you often run into using the browser default of `display: inline`.\n\nIf you ever need to make one of these elements `inline` instead of `block`, simply use the `inline` utility:\n\nHTML\n\n```\n<img class=\"inline\" src=\"...\" alt=\"...\" />\n```\n\n### [Images are constrained](#images-are-constrained)\n\nImages and videos are constrained to the parent width in a way that preserves their intrinsic aspect ratio:\n\nCSS\n\n```\nimg,video {  max-width: 100%;  height: auto;}\n```\n\nThis prevents them from overflowing their containers and makes them responsive by default. If you ever need to override this behavior, use the `max-w-none` utility:\n\nHTML\n\n```\n<img class=\"max-w-none\" src=\"...\" alt=\"...\" />\n```\n\n#### [Elements with a `hidden` attribute stay hidden](#elements-with-a-hidden-attribute-stay-hidden)\n\nCSS\n\n```\n[hidden]:where(:not([hidden=\"until-found\"])) {  display: none !important;}\n```\n\nThis enforces that elements with a `hidden` attribute stay invisible unless using `hidden=\"until-found\"`. Remove the `hidden` attribute if you want an element to be visible to the user.\n\n## [Extending Preflight](#extending-preflight)\n\nIf you'd like to add your own base styles on top of Preflight, add them to the `base` CSS layer in your CSS using `@layer base`:\n\nCSS\n\n```\n@layer base {  h1 {    font-size: var(--text-2xl);  }  h2 {    font-size: var(--text-xl);  }  h3 {    font-size: var(--text-lg);  }  a {    color: var(--color-blue-600);    text-decoration-line: underline;  }}\n```\n\nLearn more in the [adding base styles documentation](/docs/adding-custom-styles#adding-base-styles).\n\n## [Disabling Preflight](#disabling-preflight)\n\nIf you'd like to completely disable Preflight\u2014perhaps because you're integrating Tailwind into an existing project or you'd prefer to define your own base styles\u2014you can do so by importing only the parts of Tailwind that you need.\n\nBy default, this is what `@import \"tailwindcss\";` injects:\n\nCSS\n\n```\n@layer theme, base, components, utilities;@import \"tailwindcss/theme.css\" layer(theme);@import \"tailwindcss/preflight.css\" layer(base);@import \"tailwindcss/utilities.css\" layer(utilities);\n```\n\nTo disable Preflight, simply omit its import while keeping everything else:\n\nCSS\n\n```\n@layer theme, base, components, utilities;@import \"tailwindcss/theme.css\" layer(theme);@import \"tailwindcss/preflight.css\" layer(base);@import \"tailwindcss/utilities.css\" layer(utilities);\n```\n\nWhen importing Tailwind CSS' files individually, features like `source()`, `theme()`, and `prefix()` should go on their respective imports.\n\nFor example, source detection affects generated utilities, so `source(\u2026)` should be added to the `utilities.css` import:\n\nCSS\n\n```\n@layer theme, base, components, utilities;@import \"tailwindcss/theme.css\" layer(theme);@import \"tailwindcss/utilities.css\" layer(utilities);@import \"tailwindcss/utilities.css\" layer(utilities) source(none);\n```\n\nThe same goes for `important`, which also affects utilities:\n\nCSS\n\n```\n@layer theme, base, components, utilities;@import \"tailwindcss/theme.css\" layer(theme);@import \"tailwindcss/utilities.css\" layer(utilities);@import \"tailwindcss/utilities.css\" layer(utilities) important;\n```\n\nSimilarly, `theme(static)` and `theme(inline)` affect the generated theme variables and should be placed on the `theme.css` import:\n\nCSS\n\n```\n@layer theme, base, components, utilities;@import \"tailwindcss/theme.css\" layer(theme);@import \"tailwindcss/theme.css\" layer(theme) theme(static);@import \"tailwindcss/utilities.css\" layer(utilities);\n```\n\nFinally, using a prefix with `prefix(tw)` affects the utilities and variables, so it should go on both imports:\n\nCSS\n\n```\n@layer theme, base, components, utilities;@import \"tailwindcss/theme.css\" layer(theme);@import \"tailwindcss/utilities.css\" layer(utilities);@import \"tailwindcss/theme.css\" layer(theme) prefix(tw);@import \"tailwindcss/utilities.css\" layer(utilities) prefix(tw);\n```",
