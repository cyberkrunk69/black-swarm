It uses the `justify-items` value of the element\u2019s parent element.

If the property is not parallel to a standard top, right, bottom, left axis, then it behaves like `end`. |\n| `right` | Positional | Items are aligned next to each other toward the right side of the container. If the property is not parallel to a standard top, right, bottom, left axis, then it behaves like `start`. |\n| `flex-start` | Positional | A flexbox-only value (that falls back to `start`) where items are packed toward the starting edge of the container. |\n| `flex-end` | Positional | A flexbox-only value (that falls back to `end`) where items are packed toward the ending edge of the container. |\n| `self-start` | Self-Positional | Allows an item in a layout to align itself on the container edge based on its own starting side. Basically overrides what the set value is on the parent. |\n| `self-end` | Self-Positional | Allows an item in a layout to align itself on the container edge based on its own ending side instead of inheriting the the container\u2019s positional value. Basically overrides what the set value is on the parent. |\n| `first baseline` `last baseline` | Baseline | Aligns all elements within a group (i.e. cells within a row) by matching up their alignment baselines.
