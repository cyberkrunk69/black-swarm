Your HTML becomes invalid, which may not have any actual negative consequences, but robs you of that warm fuzzy valid HTML feeling. The most compelling reason is that HTML is a living language and just because attributes and values that don\u2019t do anything today doesn\u2019t mean they never will.\nGood news though: you can make up your own attributes. You just need to prefix them with\ndata-*\nand then you\u2019re free to do what you please!\nSyntax\nIt can be awfully handy to be able to make up your own HTML attributes and put your own information inside them. Fortunately, you can! That\u2019s exactly what\ndata attributes\nare. They are like this:\n<!-- They don't need a value -->\n<div data-foo></div>\n<!-- ...but they can have a value -->\n<div data-size=\"large\"></div>\n<!-- You're in HTML here, so careful to escape code if you need to do something like put more HTML inside -->\n<li data-prefix=\"Careful with HTML in here.\"><li>\n<!-- You can keep dashing if you like -->\n<aside data-some-long-attribute-name><aside>\nData attributes are often referred to as\ndata-*\nattributes, as they are always formatted like that. The word\ndata\n, then a dash\n-\n, then other text you can make up.\nCan you use the\ndata\nattribute alone?\n<div data=\"\"></div>\nIt\u2019s probably not going to hurt anything, but you won\u2019t get the JavaScript API we\u2019ll cover later in this guide. You\u2019re essentially making up an attribute for yourself, which as I mentioned in the intro, is discouraged.\nWhat\nnot\nto do with data attributes\nStore content that should be accessible. If the content should be seen or read on a page, don\u2019t only put them in data attributes, but make sure that content is in the HTML\ncontent\nsomewhere.\n<!-- This isn't accessible content -->\n<div data-name=\"Chris Coyier\"></div>\n<!-- If you need programmatic access to it but shouldn't be seen, there are other ways... -->\n<div>\n  <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Chris Coyier</span>\n</div>\nHere\u2019s more about hiding things.\nStyling with data attributes\nCSS can\nselect HTML elements based on attributes\nand their values.\n/* Select any element with this data attribute and value */\n[data-size=\"large\"] {\n  padding: 2rem;\n  font-size: 125%;\n}\n/* You can scope it to an element or class or anything else */\nbutton[data-type=\"download\"] { }\n.card[data-pad=\"extra\"] { }\nThis can be compelling. The predominant styling hooks in HTML/CSS are classes, and while classes are great (they have medium specificity and nice JavaScript methods via\nclassList\n) an element either\nhas it or it doesn\u2019t\n(essentially\non or off\n). With\ndata-*\nattributes, you get that on/off ability\nplus\nthe ability to select based on the value it has at the same specificity level.\n/* Selects if the attribute is present at all */\n[data-size] { }\n/* Selects if the attribute has a particular value */\n[data-state=\"open\"],\n[aria-expanded=\"true\"] { }\n/* \"Starts with\" selector, meaning this would match \"3\" or anything starting with 3, like \"3.14\" */\n[data-version^=\"3\"] { }\n/* \"Contains\" meaning if the value has the string anywhere inside it */\n[data-company*=\"google\"] { }\nThe specificity of attribute selectors\nIt\u2019s the exact same as a class. We often think of specificity as a four-part value:\ninline style, IDs, classes/attributes, tags\nSo a single attribute selector alone is\n0, 0, 1, 0\n. A selector like this:\ndiv.card[data-foo=\"bar\"] { }\n\u2026would be\n0, 0, 2, 1\n. The 2 is because there is one class (\n.card\n) and one attribute (\n[data-foo=\"bar\"]\n), and the 1 is because there is one tag (\ndiv\n).\nAttribute selectors have less specificity than an ID, more than an element/tag, and the same as a class.\nCase-insensitive attribute values\nIn case you\u2019re needing to correct for possible capitalization inconsistencies in your data attributes, the attribute selector has a case-insensitive variant for that.\n/* Will match\n<div data-state=\"open\"></div>\n<div data-state=\"Open\"></div>\n<div data-state=\"OPEN\"></div>\n<div data-state=\"oPeN\"></div>\n*/\n[data-state=\"open\" i] { }\nIt\u2019s the little\ni\nwithin the bracketed selector.\nUsing data attributes visually\nCSS allows you to yank out the data attribute value and display it if you need to.\n/* <div data-emoji=\"\u2705\"> */\n[data-emoji]::before {\n  content: attr(data-emoji); /* Returns '\u2705' */\n  margin-right: 5px;\n}\nExample styling use-case\nYou could use data attributes to specify how many columns you want a grid container to have.\n<div data-columns=\"2\"></div>\n<div data-columns=\"3\"></div>\n<div data-columns=\"4\"></div>\nAccessing data attributes in JavaScript\nLike any other attribute, you can access the value with the generic method\ngetAttribute\n.\nlet value = el.getAttribute(\"data-state\");\n// You can set the value as well.\n// Returns data-state=\"collapsed\"\nel.setAttribute(\"data-state\", \"collapsed\");\nBut data attributes have their own special API as well. Say you have an element with multiple data attributes (which is totally fine):\n<span \n  data-info=\"123\" \n  data-index=\"2\" \n  data-prefix=\"Dr. \"\n  data-emoji-icon=\"\ud83c\udfcc\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\"\n></span>\nIf you have a reference to that element, you can set and get the attributes like:\n// Get\nspan.dataset.info; // 123\nspan.dataset.index; // 2\n// Set\nspan.dataset.prefix = \"Mr. \";\nspan.dataset.emojiIcon = \"\ud83c\udfaa\";\nNote the camelCase usage on the last line there. It automatically converts kebab-style attributes in HTML, like\ndata-this-little-piggy\n, to camelCase style in JavaScript, like\ndataThisLittlePiggy\n.\nThis API is arguably not quite as nice as\nclassList\nwith the clear\nadd\n,\nremove\n,\ntoggle\n, and\nreplace\nmethods, but it\u2019s better than nothing.\nYou have access to inline datasets as well:\n<img src=\"spaceship.png\"\n  data-ship-id=\"324\" data-shields=\"72%\"\n  onclick=\"pewpew(this.dataset.shipId)\">\n</img>\nJSON data inside data attributes\n<ul>\n  <li data-person='\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Chris Coyier\",\n      \"job\": \"Web Person\"\n    }\n  '></li>\n</ul>\nHey, why not? It\u2019s just a string and it\u2019s possible to format it as valid JSON (mind the quotes and such). You can yank that data and parse it as needed.\nconst el = document.querySelector(\"li\");\nlet json = el.dataset.person;\nlet data = JSON.parse(json);\nconsole.log(data.name); // Chris Coyier\nconsole.log(data.job); // Web Person\nJavaScript use-cases\nThe concept is that you can use data attributes to put information in HTML that JavaScript may need access to do certain things.\nA common one would have to do with database functionality. Say you have a \u201cLike\u201d button:\n<button data-id=\"435432343\">\u2661</button>\nThat button could have a click handler on it which performs an Ajax request to the server to increment the number of likes in a database on click.

A selector like this:\n\n```\ndiv.card[data-foo=\"bar\"] { }\n```\n\n\u2026would be **0, 0, 2, 1**. The 2 is because there is one class (`.card`) and one attribute (`[data-foo=\"bar\"]`), and the 1 is because there is one tag (`div`).\n\n![Illustration of a CSS selector including a data attribute.](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/specificity-selector.png?fit=1024%2C386&ssl=1)\n\nAttribute selectors have less specificity than an ID, more than an element/tag, and the same as a class.\n\n#### Case-insensitive attribute values\n\nIn case you\u2019re needing to correct for possible capitalization inconsistencies in your data attributes, the attribute selector has a case-insensitive variant for that.\n\n```\n/* Will match\n<div data-state=\"open\"></div>\n<div data-state=\"Open\"></div>\n<div data-state=\"OPEN\"></div>\n<div data-state=\"oPeN\"></div>\n*/\n[data-state=\"open\" i] { }\n```\n\nIt\u2019s the little `i` within the bracketed selector.\n\n#### Using data attributes visually\n\nCSS allows you to yank out the data attribute value and display it if you need to.\n\n```\n/* <div data-emoji=\"\u2705\"> */\n[data-emoji]::before {\n  content: attr(data-emoji); /* Returns '\u2705' */\n  margin-right: 5px;\n}\n```\n\n#### Example styling use-case\n\nYou could use data attributes to specify how many columns you want a grid container to have.\n\n```\n<div data-columns=\"2\"></div>\n<div data-columns=\"3\"></div>\n<div data-columns=\"4\"></div>\n```\n\n### Accessing data attributes in JavaScript\n\nLike any other attribute, you can access the value with the generic method `getAttribute`.\n\n```\nlet value = el.getAttribute(\"data-state\");\n// You can set the value as well.\n// Returns data-state=\"collapsed\"\nel.setAttribute(\"data-state\", \"collapsed\");\n```\n\nBut data attributes have their own special API as well.
