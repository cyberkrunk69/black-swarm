  "content": "Dark mode has gained a lot of traction recently. Like Apple, for instance, has added dark mode to its iOS and MacOS operating systems. Windows and Google have done the same.\nDuckDuckGo\u2019s light and dark themes\nLet\u2019s get into dark mode in the context of\nwebsites\n. We\u2019ll delve into different options and approaches to implementing a dark mode design and the technical considerations they entail. We\u2019ll also touch upon some design tips along the way.\nTable of Contents\nToggling Themes\nDark Mode at the Operating System Level\nStoring a User\u2019s Preferences\nHandling User Agent Styles\nCombining Approaches\nDesign Considerations\nDark Mode in the Wild\nDark Mode or No Dark Mode?\nToggling Themes\nThe typical scenario is that you already have a light theme for your site, and you\u2019re interested in making a darker counterpart. Or, even if you\u2019re starting from scratch, you\u2019ll have both themes: light and dark. One theme should be defined as the default that users get on first visit, which is the light theme in most cases (though we can let the user\u2019s browser make that choice for us, as we\u2019ll see). There also should be a way to switch to the other theme (which can be done automatically, as we\u2019ll also see) \u2014 as in, the user clicks a button and the color theme changes.\nThere several approaches to go about doing this:\nUsing a Body Class\nThe trick here is to swap out a class that can be a hook for changing a style anywhere on the page.\n<body class=\"dark-theme || light-theme\">\nHere\u2019s a script for a button that will toggle that class, for example:\n// Select the button\nconst btn = document.querySelector('.btn-toggle');\n\n// Listen for a click on the button\nbtn.addEventListener('click', function() {\n  // Then toggle (add/remove) the .dark-theme class to the body\n  document.body.classList.toggle('dark-theme');  \n})\nHere\u2019s how we can use that idea:\n<body>\n\u00a0 <button class=\"btn-toggle\">Toggle Dark Mode</button>\n\u00a0 <h1>Hey there! This is just a title</h1>\n\u00a0 <p>I am just a boring text, existing here solely for the purpose of this demo</p>\n\u00a0 <p>And I am just another one like the one above me, because two is better than having only one</p>\n\u00a0 <a href=\"#\">I am a link, don't click me!</a>\n</body>\nThe general idea of this approach is to style things up as we normally would, call that our\u00a0\u201cdefault\u201d\u00a0mode, then create a complete set of color styles using a class set on the\n<body>\nelement we can use as a\u00a0\u201cdark\u201d\u00a0mode.\nLet\u2019s say our default is a light color scheme. All of those\u00a0\u201clight\u201d\u00a0styles are written exactly the same way you normally write CSS. Given our HTML, let\u2019s apply some global styling to the body and to links.\nbody {\n\u00a0 color: #222;\n\u00a0 background: #fff;\n}\na {\n\u00a0 color: #0033cc;\n}\nGood good. We have dark text\u00a0(\n#222\n)\u00a0and dark links\u00a0(\n#0033cc\n)\u00a0on a light background\u00a0(\n#fff\n).\u00a0Our\u00a0\u201cdefault\u201d\u00a0theme is off to a solid start.\nNow let\u2019s redefine those property values, this time set on a different body class:\nbody {\n\u00a0 color: #222;\n\u00a0 background: #fff;\n}\na {\n\u00a0 color: #0033cc;\n}\n\u2028\n/* Dark Mode styles */\nbody.dark-theme {\n\u00a0 color: #eee;\n\u00a0 background: #121212;\n}\nbody.dark-theme a {\n\u00a0 color: #809fff;\n}\nDark theme styles will be descendants of\u00a0the\u00a0same parent class\u00a0\u2014 which is\n.dark-theme\nin this example\u00a0\u2014 which\u00a0we\u2019ve applied\u00a0to the\n<body>\ntag.\nHow do we\u00a0\u201cswitch\u201d\u00a0body classes to access the dark styles? We can use JavaScript! We\u2019ll select the button class\u00a0(\n.btn-toggle\n),\u00a0add a listener for when it\u2019s clicked, then add the dark theme class\u00a0(\n.dark-theme\n)\u00a0to the body element\u2019s class list. That effectively overrides all of the\u00a0\u201clight\u201d\u00a0colors we set, thanks to the cascade and specificity.\nHere\u2019s the complete code working in action. Click the toggle button to toggle in and out of dark mode.\nUsing Separate Stylesheets\nRather than keeping all the styles together in one stylesheet, we could instead toggle between stylesheets for each theme. This assumes you have full stylesheets ready to go.\nFor example, a default light theme like\nlight-theme.css\n:\n/* light-theme.css */\n\u2028\nbody {\n\u00a0 color: #222;\n\u00a0 background: #fff;\n}\na {\n\u00a0 color: #0033cc;\n}\nThen\u00a0we\u00a0create styles for the dark theme and save\u00a0them\u00a0in a separate stylesheet we\u2019re calling\ndark-theme.css\n.\n/* dark-theme.css */\n\u2028\nbody {\n\u00a0 color: #eee;\n\u00a0 background: #121212;\n}\nbody a {\n\u00a0 color: #809fff;\n}\nThis gives us two\u00a0separate\u00a0stylesheets\u00a0\u2014 one\u00a0for each theme\u00a0\u2014 we can link up in the HTML\n<head>\nsection. Let\u2019s link up the light styles first since we\u2019re calling those the default.\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n\u00a0 <!-- Light theme stylesheet -->\n\u00a0 <link href=\"light-theme.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" id=\"theme-link\">\n</head>\n\u2028\n<!-- etc. -->\n\u2028\n</html>\nWe are using\u00a0a\n#theme-link\nID\u00a0that we can select with JavaScript\u00a0to, again, toggle between light and dark mode. Only this time, we\u2019re toggling files instead of classes.\n// Select the button\nconst btn = document.querySelector(\".btn-toggle\");\n// Select the stylesheet <link>\nconst theme = document.querySelector(\"#theme-link\");\n\n// Listen for a click on the button\nbtn.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n  // If the current URL contains \"ligh-theme.css\"\n  if (theme.getAttribute(\"href\") == \"light-theme.css\") {\n    // ... then switch it to \"dark-theme.css\"\n    theme.href = \"dark-theme.css\";\n  // Otherwise...\n  } else {\n    // ... switch it to \"light-theme.css\"\n    theme.href = \"light-theme.css\";\n  }\n});\nView Demo\nUsing Custom Properties\nWe\u00a0can\u00a0also\u00a0leverage the power of CSS\u00a0custom properties\u00a0to create a dark theme!\u00a0It helps us avoid having to write separate style rulesets for each theme, making it a lot faster to write styles and a lot easier to make changes to a theme if we need to.\nWe still might choose to swap a body class, and use that class to re-set custom properties:\n// Select the button\nconst btn = document.querySelector(\".btn-toggle\");\n\u2028\n// Listen for a click on the button\nbtn.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n\u00a0 // Then toggle (add/remove) the .dark-theme class to the body\n\u00a0 document.body.classList.toggle(\"dark-theme\");\n});\nFirst,\u00a0let\u2019s define the default light color values as custom properties on the body element:\nbody {\n\u00a0 --text-color: #222;\n\u00a0 --bkg-color: #fff;\n\u00a0 --anchor-color: #0033cc;\n}\nNow we can redefine those values on a\n.dark-theme\nbody class just like we did in the first method:\nbody.dark-theme {\n\u00a0 --text-color: #eee;\n\u00a0 --bkg-color: #121212;\n\u00a0 --anchor-color: #809fff;\n}\nHere are our rulesets for the body and link elements using custom properties:\nbody {\n\u00a0 color: var(--text-color);\n\u00a0 background: var(--bkg-color);\n}\na {\n\u00a0 color: var(--anchor-color);\n}\nWe could just as well have defined our custom properties inside the document\n:root\n. That\u2019s totally legit and\neven common practice\n. In that case, all the default theme styles definitions would go inside\n:root { }\nand all of the dark theme properties go inside\n:root.dark-mode { }\n.\nUsing Server-Side Scripts\nIf we\u2019re already working with a server-side language, say PHP,\u00a0then we can use it instead of JavaScript. This is a great approach if you prefer working directly in the markup.\n<?php\n$themeClass = '';\nif (isset($_GET['theme']) && $_GET['theme'] == 'dark') {\n\u00a0 $themeClass = 'dark-theme';\n}\n\u2028\n$themeToggle = ($themeClass == 'dark-theme') ? 'light' : 'dark';\n?>\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<!-- etc. -->\n<body class=\"<?php echo $themeClass; ?>\">\n\u00a0 <a href=\"?theme=<?php echo $themeToggle; ?>\">Toggle Dark Mode</a>\n\u00a0 <!-- etc. -->\n</body>\n</html>\nWe can have the user send a\nGET\nor\nPOST\nrequest. Then,\u00a0we let our code\u00a0(PHP\u00a0in this case)\u00a0apply\u00a0the appropriate\u00a0body\u00a0class when the page is reloaded. I am using a\nGET\nrequest (URL params) for the purpose of this demonstration.\nAnd, yes, we\u00a0can\u00a0swap stylesheets just like we did in the second method.\n<?php\n$themeStyleSheet = 'light-theme.css';\nif (isset($_GET['theme']) && $_GET['theme'] == 'dark') {\n\u00a0 $themeStyleSheet = 'dark-theme.css';\n}\n\u2028\n$themeToggle = ($themeStyleSheet == 'dark-theme.css') ? 'light' : 'dark';\n?>\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n\u00a0 <!-- etc. -->\n\u00a0 <link href=\"<?php echo $themeStyleSheet; ?>\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n</head>\n\u2028\n<body>\n\u00a0 <a href=\"?theme=<?php echo $themeToggle; ?>\">Toggle Dark Mode</a>\n\u00a0 <!-- etc. -->\n</body>\n</html>\nThis method has an obvious downside: the page needs to be refreshed for the toggle\u00a0to take place. But a server-side solution like this is useful in persisting the user\u2019s theme choice across page reloads, as we will see later.\nWhich method should you choose?\nThe \u201cright\u201d method comes down to the requirements of your project. If you are doing a large project, for example, you might go with CSS properties to help wrangle a large codebase. On the other hand, if your project needs to support legacy browsers, then another approach will need to do instead.\nMoreover, there\u2019s nothing saying we can only use one method. Sometimes a combination of methods will be the most effective route. There may even be other possible methods than what we have discussed.\nDark Mode at the Operating System Level\nSo far, we\u2019ve used a button to toggle between light and dark mode but we can simply let the user\u2019s operating system do that lifting for us. For example, many operating systems let users choose between light and dark themes directly in the system settings.\nThe\u00a0\u201cGeneral\u201d\u00a0settings in MacOS System Preferences\nPure CSS\nDetails\nFortunately, CSS has a\nprefers-color-scheme\nmedia query\u00a0which can be used to detect user\u2019s system color scheme preferences. It can have three possible values:\u00a0no preference,\u00a0light\u00a0and\u00a0dark. Read more about it\non MDN\n.\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n\u00a0 /* Dark theme styles go here */\n}\n\u2028\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {\n\u00a0 /* Light theme styles go here */\n}\nTo use it, we can put the dark theme styles inside the media query.\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n\u00a0 body {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 color: #eee;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 background: #121212;\n\u00a0 }\n\u2028\n\u00a0 a {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 color: #809fff;\n\u00a0 }\n}\nNow, if a user has\u00a0enabled\u00a0dark mode from\u00a0the\u00a0system settings, they\u00a0will\u00a0get the dark mode styles\u00a0by default.\u00a0We don\u2019t have to resort to JavaScript or server-side scripts to decide which mode to use. Heck, we don\u2019t even need the button anymore!\nJavaScript\nDetails\nWe can turn to\u00a0JavaScript to detect the\u00a0user\u2019s preferred\u00a0color scheme.\u00a0This is a lot like the first method we worked with, only we\u2019re using\nmatchedMedia()\nto detect the user\u2019s preference.\nconst prefersDarkScheme = window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)');nnif (prefersDarkScheme.matches) {n  document.body.classList.add('dark-theme');n} else {n  document.body.classList.remove('dark-theme');n}\nThere is a downside to using JavaScript: there will likely be a quick flash of the light theme\u00a0as JavaScript is executed after the CSS.\u00a0That could be misconstrued as a bug.\nAnd, of course, we can swap stylesheets instead like we did in the second method. This time, we link up both stylesheets and use the media query to determine which one is applied.\nOverriding OS Settings\nWe just looked at how to account for a user\u2019s system-wide color scheme preferences.\nBut what if users want to override their system preference for a site?\nJust because a user prefers dark mode for their OS doesn\u2019t always mean they prefer it on a website. That\u2019s why providing a way to manually override dark mode, despite the system settings, is a good idea.\nView Code\nLet\u2019s use the CSS custom properties approach to demonstrate how to do this. The idea is to define the custom properties for both themes like we did before, wrap dark styles up in the\nprefers-color-scheme\nmedia query, then define a\n.light-theme\nclass inside of that we can use to override the dark mode properties, should the user want to toggle between the two modes.\n/* Default colors */\nbody {\n\u00a0 --text-color: #222;\n\u00a0 --bkg-color: #fff;\n}\n/* Dark theme colors */\nbody.dark-theme {\n\u00a0 --text-color: #eee;\n\u00a0 --bkg-color: #121212;\n}\n\n/* Styles for users who prefer dark mode at the OS level */\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n\u00a0 /* defaults to dark theme */\n\u00a0 body {\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 --text-color: #eee;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 --bkg-color: #121212;\n\u00a0 }\n\u00a0 /* Override dark mode with light mode styles if the user decides to swap */\n\u00a0 body.light-theme {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 --text-color: #222;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 --bkg-color: #fff;\n\u00a0 }\n}\nNow we can turn back to our trusty button to toggle between light and dark themes.\nThis way, we\u2019re respecting the OS color preference by default\nand\nallowing the user to manually switch themes.\n// Listen for a click on the button\u00a0\nbtn.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n\u00a0 // If the OS is set to dark mode...\n\u00a0 if (prefersDarkScheme.matches) {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 // ...then apply the .light-theme class to override those styles\n\u00a0 \u00a0 document.body.classList.toggle(\"light-theme\");\n\u00a0 \u00a0 // Otherwise...\n\u00a0 } else {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 // ...apply the .dark-theme class to override the default light styles\n\u00a0 \u00a0 document.body.classList.toggle(\"dark-theme\");\n\u00a0 }\n});\nBrowser Support\nThe\nprefers-color-scheme\nmedia query feature enjoys support by major browsers, including Chrome 76+, Firefox 67+, Chrome Android 76+, Safari 12.5+ (13+ on iOS), and Samsung Internet Browser. It doesn\u2019t support IE.\nThat\u2019s a promising amount of support!\nCan I Use\nestimates 80.85% of user coverage.\nOperating systems that currently support dark mode include MacOS (Mojave or later), iOS (13.0+), Windows (10+), and Android (10+).\nStoring a User\u2019s Preference\nWhat we\u2019ve looked at so far definitely does what it says in the tin: swap themes based on an OS preference or a button click. This is great, but doesn\u2019t carry over when the user either visits another page on the site or reloads the current page.\nWe need to save the user\u2019s choice so that it will be applied consistently throughout the site and on subsequent visits. To do that, we can save the user\u2019s choice to the\nlocalStorage\nwhen the theme is toggled. Cookies are also well-suited for the job.\nLet\u2019s look at both approaches.\nUsing localStorage\nWe have a script that saves the selected theme to localStorage when the toggle takes place. In other words, when the page is reloaded, the script fetches the choice from\nlocalStorage\nand applies it. JavaScript is often executed after CSS, so this approach is prone to a\n\u201cflash of incorrect theme\u201d (FOIT)\n.\nView Code\n// Select the button\nconst btn = document.querySelector(\".btn-toggle\");\n// Select the theme preference from localStorage\nconst currentTheme = localStorage.getItem(\"theme\");\n\u2028\n// If the current theme in localStorage is \"dark\"...\nif (currentTheme == \"dark\") {\n\u00a0 // ...then use the .dark-theme class\n\u00a0 document.body.classList.add(\"dark-theme\");\n}\n\u2028\n// Listen for a click on the button\u00a0\nbtn.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n\u00a0 // Toggle the .dark-theme class on each click\n\u00a0 document.body.classList.toggle(\"dark-theme\");\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 // Let's say the theme is equal to light\n\u00a0 let theme = \"light\";\n\u00a0 // If the body contains the .dark-theme class...\n\u00a0 if (document.body.classList.contains(\"dark-theme\")) {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 // ...then let's make the theme dark\n\u00a0 \u00a0 theme = \"dark\";\n\u00a0 }\n\u00a0 // Then save the choice in localStorage\n\u00a0 localStorage.setItem(\"theme\", theme);\n});\nUsing Cookies with PHP\nTo avoid FLIC, we can use a server-side script like PHP. Instead of saving the user\u2019s theme preference in\nlocalStorage\n, we will create a cookie from JavaScript and save it there. But again, this may only be feasible if you\u2019re already working with a server-side language.\nView Code\n// Select the button\nconst btn = document.querySelector(\".btn-toggle\");\n\u2028\n// Listen for a click on the button\u00a0\nbtn.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n\u00a0 // Toggle the .dark-theme class on the body\n\u00a0 document.body.classList.toggle(\"dark-theme\");\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 // Let's say the theme is equal to light\n\u00a0 let theme = \"light\";\n\u00a0 // If the body contains the .dark-theme class...\n\u00a0 if (document.body.classList.contains(\"dark-theme\")) {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 // ...then let's make the theme dark\n\u00a0 \u00a0 theme = \"dark\";\n\u00a0 }\n\u00a0 // Then save the choice in a cookie\n\u00a0 document.cookie = \"theme=\" + theme;\n});\nWe can now check for the existence of that cookie and load the appropriate theme by applying the proper class to the\n<body>\ntag.\n<?php\n$themeClass = '';\nif (!empty($_COOKIE['theme']) && $_COOKIE['theme'] == 'dark') {\n\u00a0 $themeClass = 'dark-theme';\n}\n?>\n\u2028\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<!-- etc. -->\n<body class=\"<?php echo $themeClass; ?>\">\n<!-- etc. -->\n</body>\n</html>\nHere is how to do that using the separate stylesheets method:\n<?php\n$themeStyleSheet = 'light-theme.css';\nif (!empty($_COOKIE['theme']) && $_COOKIE['theme'] == 'dark') {\n\u00a0 $themeStyleSheet = 'dark-theme.css';\n}\n?>\n\u2028\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n\u00a0 <!-- etc. -->\n\u00a0 <link href=\"<?php echo $themeStyleSheet; ?>\" rel=\"stylesheet\" id=\"theme-link\">\n</head>\n<!-- etc. -->\nIf your website has user accounts \u2014 like a place to log in and manage profile stuff \u2014 that\u2019s also a great place to save theme preferences. Send those to the database where user account details are stored. Then, when the user logs in, fetch the theme from the database and apply it to the page using PHP (or whatever server-side script).\nThere are various ways to do this. In this example, I am fetching the user\u2019s theme preference from the database and saving it in a session variable at the time of login.\n<?php\n// Login action\nif (!empty($_POST['login'])) {\n\u00a0 // etc.\n\u2028\n\u00a0 // If the uuser is authenticated...\n\u00a0 if ($loginSuccess) {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 // ... save their theme preference to a session variable\n\u00a0 \u00a0 $_SESSION['user_theme'] = $userData['theme'];\n\u00a0 }\n}\n\u2028\n// Pick the session variable first if it's set; otherwise pick the cookie\n$themeChoice = $_SESSION['user_theme'] ?? $_COOKIE['theme'] ?? null;\n$themeClass = '';\nif ($themeChoice == 'dark') {\n\u00a0 $themeClass = 'dark-theme';\n}\n?>\n\u2028\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<!-- etc. -->\n<body class=\"<?php echo $themeClass; ?>\">\n<!-- etc. -->\n</body>\n</html>\nI am using PHP\u2019s\nnull coalesce operator\n(\n??\n) to decide where to  pick the theme preference: from the session or from the cookie. If the user is logged in, the value of the session variable is taken instead that of the cookie. And if the user is not logged in or has logged out, the value of cookie is taken.\nHandling User Agent Styles\nTo inform the browser UA stylesheet about the system color scheme preferences and tell it which color schemes are supported in the page, we can use the\ncolor-scheme\nmeta tag.\nFor example, let\u2019s say the page should support both \u201cdark\u201d and \u201clight\u201d themes. We can put both of them as values in the meta tag, separated by spaces. If we only want to support a \u201clight\u201d theme, then we only need to use \u201clight\u201d as the value. This is discussed in a\nCSSWG GitHub issue\n, where it was originally proposed.\n<meta name=\"color-scheme\" content=\"dark light\">\nWhen this meta tag is added, the browser takes the user\u2019s color scheme preferences into consideration when rendering UA-controlled elements of the page (like a\n<button>\n).

While I\u2019ll refrain from judgement, let\u2019s look at some considerations for designing a dark theme.\nYou already know the basic task: swap lighter color values for darker ones and vice versa. But there are some UI elements and enhancements that are more nuanced and require more attention. Let\u2019s take a look at those.\nDark Mode Images\nA good rule is to decrease the brightness and contrast of images a bit so that it looks comfortable to the eyes when it\u2019s against a dark background. A super bright image on a super dark background can be jarring and dimming the image reduces some of that heavy contrast.\nThe CSS\nfilter()\nfunction is more than capable of handling this for us:\n/* Apply the filter directly on the body tag */\nbody.dark-theme img {\n\u00a0 filter: brightness(.8) contrast(1.2);\n}\n\u2028\n/* Or apply it via media query */\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n\u00a0 img {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 filter: brightness(.8) contrast(1.2);\n\u00a0 }\n}\nWe can do the same sort of thing directly in the markup using the\n<picture>\nelement to load different versions of an image:\n<picture>\n\u00a0 <!-- Use this image if the user's OS setting is light or unset -->\n\u00a0 <source srcset=\"photo-light.png\" media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light) or (prefers-color-scheme: no-preference)\">\n\u00a0 <!-- Use this image if the user's OS setting is dark -->\n\u00a0 <source srcset=\"photo-dark.png\" media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\">\n</picture>\nThe downside here is that it requires supplying two files where we only have to deal with one when using CSS. This also doesn\u2019t fully account for the user toggling the color theme on the site.\nDark Mode Shadows\nDark mode shadows are tricky. If we simply invert a dark shadow using light colors, then we get this funky thing with a light shadow on a dark background\u2026 and it\u2019s not a good look.\nIt\u2019s possible to use a dark shadow in dark mode, but the background color has to be \u201clight\u201d enough (like a dark gray) to provide enough contrast to actually see the shadow against it.\n\ud83d\udd25 When implementing dark mode, don\u2019t throw away the visual cues in the light version by naively inverting the color scheme.\nClose elements should still be lighter and distant elements should still be darker \u2013 even in a dark UI.\npic.twitter.com/RNxgIppDmn\n\u2014 Steve Schoger (@steveschoger)\nJuly 16, 2019\nUse opacity to convey depth, with high opacity regions having a lower depth. That\u2019s to say, elements that have a higher elevation should have a lower opacity than elements that are \u201ccloser\u201d in depth to the background.\nDifferent shades of color create different perceptions of \u201cdepth\u201d\nDark Mode Typography\nThe trick here is a lot like images: we\u2019ve gotta balance the contrast. Use too heavy of a font and we get blaring text that\u2019s makes us want to move away from the screen. Use too light of a font and we\u2019ll strain our eyes while inching toward the screen to get a closer look.\nThe balance is somewhere in the middle.\nRobin has a nice write-up\nwhere he suggests a small bit of CSS that makes a big difference in legibility.\nDark Mode Icons\nIcons fall into this \u201ctricky\u201d category because they\u2019re sort of a cross between text and images. If we\u2019re working with SVG icons, though, we can change the fill with CSS. On the other hand, if we\u2019re using font icons, we can simply change the color property instead.\n/* SVG icon */\nbody.dark-theme svg.icon path {\n\u00a0 fill: #efefef;\n}\n/* Font icon (using Font Awesome as an example) */\nbody.dark-theme .fa {\n\u00a0 color: #efefef;\n}\nA lot of the same design considerations that are true for text, are also generally applicable to icons. For example, we ought to avoid using full white and heavy outlines.\nDark Mode Colors\nPure white text on a pure black background will look jarring. The trick here is to use an off-white for the text and off-black for the background.\nMaterial Design Guidelines\nfor example recommends\n#121212\nfor the background.\nDark Mode Color Palettes\nWe\u2019ve seen the difference using off-white and off-black colors makes for text and images. Let\u2019s expand on that a bit with tips on how to develop a full color palette.\nMost things boil down to one thing:\ncontrast\n. That\u2019s why the first tip before settling on any color is to run ideas through a contrast checker to ensure color ratios conform to WCAG\u2019s guidelines for at least a AA rating,\nwhich is a contrast ratio of 4.5:1\n.\nThat means desaturated colors are our friends when working with a dark mode design. They help prevent overbearingly bright images and still give us plenty of room to create an effective contrast ratio.\nNext, remember that accent colors are meant to be enhancements. They\u2019re likely brighter than the dark theme background color, so using them like a primary color or the background color of a large container is just as jarring and hard on the eyes as a bright image or heavy white text.\nIf contrast is the balance we\u2019re trying to strike, then remember that dark mode is more than blacks and grays. What about dark blue background with pale yellow text? Or dark brown with tan? There\u2019s an entire (and\ngrowing\n) spectrum of color out there and we can leverage any part of it to fuel creativity.\nA few examples of colors that are dark without resorting to full-on black:\n#232B32\n#152028\n#202945\nMaterial Design\u2019s guidelines on dark mode\nis a handy resource on best practices for dark mode design. It\u2019s definitely worth a read for more tips to keep in mind.\nDark Mode in the Wild\nDuckDuckGo\nTwitter\nYouTube\nSlack\nSlack\nDropbox Paper\nSimplenote\nYouTube uses the CSS variables technique. They\u2019ve defined all their colors in variables under the html selector while dark mode colors are defined under\nhtml:not(.style-scope)[dark]\n. When dark mode is enabled, YouTube adds a\ndark=\"true\"\nattribute to the\n<html>\ntag. This is what they use to override the variables defined in the HTML.\nYouTube adds\ndark=true\nattribute to the\n<html>\nwhen it switches to the dark mode.\nIn the wild, the CSS custom properties approach seems to be most popular. It\u2019s being used by Dropbox Paper, Slack, and Facebook.\nSimplenote\nuses the class-swapping method where all light style rules are descendants of a\n.theme-light\nparent class and all the dark styles fall under a\n.theme-dark\nclass. When the theme is toggled, the appropriate class is applied to the\n<body>\ntag.\nSimplenote uses two classes:\n.light-theme\nand\n.dark-theme\nto style the themes.\nTwitter goes the extra mile and offers several themes to choose from: \u201cDefault,\u201d \u201cDim,\u201d and \u201cLights out.\u201d The \u201cDim\u201d option employs dark blue for a background color. Compare that to \u201cLights out\u201d which uses a stark black.\nTwitter offers three themes to choose from.\nDark mode or no dark mode? That is the question.\nThere are perfectly valid reasons on both sides. Some of those reasons even go beyond the scope of user experience and include things like timing, budget and resources.\nWhile being considerate of why you might not want to implement a dark mode, here are reasons why you might want to have one:\nIt\u2019s cool and trendy (although that\u2019s not a reason alone to do it)\nIt enhances accessibility by supporting users who are sensitive to eye strain in starkly bright themes.\nIt allows users to decide the most comfortable way to consume content while providing us a way to maintain control over the look and feel of things. Remember, we want to\nbeat the Reader Mode button\n!\nIt helps to preserve battery life for devices with OLED screen where brighter colors consume more energy.\nIt\u2019s extremely popular and appears to be going nowhere. It\u2019s possible that your users who prefer a dark mode (like me!) will expect your site to have one. Might as well be ready for it.",

Windows and Google have done the same.\n\n![](https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/OyfkbMzf.png?fit=1024%2C476&ssl=1)\n\nDuckDuckGo\u2019s light and dark themes\n\nLet\u2019s get into dark mode in the context of **websites**. We\u2019ll delve into different options and approaches to implementing a dark mode design and the technical considerations they entail. We\u2019ll also touch upon some design tips along the way.\n\n#### Table of Contents\n\n1. [Toggling Themes](#toggling-themes)\n2. [Dark Mode at the Operating System Level](#os-level)\n3.

[Dark Mode or No Dark Mode?](#decide)\n\n---\n\n### Toggling Themes\n\nThe typical scenario is that you already have a light theme for your site, and you\u2019re interested in making a darker counterpart. Or, even if you\u2019re starting from scratch, you\u2019ll have both themes: light and dark. One theme should be defined as the default that users get on first visit, which is the light theme in most cases (though we can let the user\u2019s browser make that choice for us, as we\u2019ll see). There also should be a way to switch to the other theme (which can be done automatically, as we\u2019ll also see) \u2014 as in, the user clicks a button and the color theme changes.\n\nThere several approaches to go about doing this:\n\n#### Using a Body Class\n\nThe trick here is to swap out a class that can be a hook for changing a style anywhere on the page.\n\n```\n<body class=\"dark-theme || light-theme\">\n```\n\nHere\u2019s a script for a button that will toggle that class, for example:\n\n```\n// Select the button\nconst btn = document.querySelector('.btn-toggle');\n\n// Listen for a click on the button\nbtn.addEventListener('click', function() {\n  // Then toggle (add/remove) the .dark-theme class to the body\n  document.body.classList.toggle('dark-theme');  \n})\n```\n\nHere\u2019s how we can use that idea:\n\n```\n<body>\n\u00a0 <button class=\"btn-toggle\">Toggle Dark Mode</button>\n\u00a0 <h1>Hey there! This is just a title</h1>\n\u00a0 <p>I am just a boring text, existing here solely for the purpose of this demo</p>\n\u00a0 <p>And I am just another one like the one above me, because two is better than having only one</p>\n\u00a0 <a href=\"#\">I am a link, don't click me!</a>\n</body>\n```\n\nThe general idea of this approach is to style things up as we normally would, call that our\u00a0\u201cdefault\u201d\u00a0mode, then create a complete set of color styles using a class set on the\u00a0`<body>`\u00a0\u00a0element we can use as a\u00a0\u201cdark\u201d\u00a0mode.\n\nLet\u2019s say our default is a light color scheme. All of those\u00a0\u201clight\u201d\u00a0styles are written exactly the same way you normally write CSS. Given our HTML, let\u2019s apply some global styling to the body and to links.\n\n```\nbody {\n\u00a0 color: #222;\n\u00a0 background: #fff;\n}\na {\n\u00a0 color: #0033cc;\n}\n```\n\nGood good. We have dark text\u00a0(`#222`)\u00a0and dark links\u00a0(`#0033cc`)\u00a0on a light background\u00a0(`#fff`).\u00a0Our\u00a0\u201cdefault\u201d\u00a0theme is off to a solid start.\n\nNow let\u2019s redefine those property values, this time set on a different body class:\n\n```\nbody {\n\u00a0 color: #222;\n\u00a0 background: #fff;\n}\na {\n\u00a0 color: #0033cc;\n}\n\u2028\n/* Dark Mode styles */\nbody.dark-theme {\n\u00a0 color: #eee;\n\u00a0 background: #121212;\n}\nbody.dark-theme a {\n\u00a0 color: #809fff;\n}\n```\n\nDark theme styles will be descendants of\u00a0the\u00a0same parent class\u00a0\u2014 which is\u00a0`.dark-theme`\u00a0in this example\u00a0\u2014 which\u00a0we\u2019ve applied\u00a0to the\u00a0`<body>`\u00a0tag.\n\nHow do we\u00a0\u201cswitch\u201d\u00a0body classes to access the dark styles? We can use JavaScript! We\u2019ll select the button class\u00a0(`.btn-toggle`),\u00a0add a listener for when it\u2019s clicked, then add the dark theme class\u00a0(`.dark-theme`)\u00a0to the body element\u2019s class list. That effectively overrides all of the\u00a0\u201clight\u201d\u00a0colors we set, thanks to the cascade and specificity.\n\nHere\u2019s the complete code working in action. Click the toggle button to toggle in and out of dark mode.\n\n#### Using Separate Stylesheets\n\nRather than keeping all the styles together in one stylesheet, we could instead toggle between stylesheets for each theme. This assumes you have full stylesheets ready to go.\n\nFor example, a default light theme like\u00a0`light-theme.css`:\n\n```\n/* light-theme.css */\n\u2028\nbody {\n\u00a0 color: #222;\n\u00a0 background: #fff;\n}\na {\n\u00a0 color: #0033cc;\n}\n```\n\nThen\u00a0we\u00a0create styles for the dark theme and save\u00a0them\u00a0in a separate stylesheet we\u2019re calling\u00a0`dark-theme.css`.\n\n```\n/* dark-theme.css */\n\u2028\nbody {\n\u00a0 color: #eee;\n\u00a0 background: #121212;\n}\nbody a {\n\u00a0 color: #809fff;\n}\n```\n\nThis gives us two\u00a0separate\u00a0stylesheets\u00a0\u2014 one\u00a0for each theme\u00a0\u2014 we can link up in the HTML\u00a0`<head>`\u00a0section. Let\u2019s link up the light styles first since we\u2019re calling those the default.\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n\u00a0 <!-- Light theme stylesheet -->\n\u00a0 <link href=\"light-theme.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" id=\"theme-link\">\n</head>\n\u2028\n<!-- etc. -->\n\u2028\n</html>\n```\n\nWe are using\u00a0a\u00a0`#theme-link`\u00a0ID\u00a0that we can select with JavaScript\u00a0to, again, toggle between light and dark mode. Only this time, we\u2019re toggling files instead of classes.\n\n```\n// Select the button\nconst btn = document.querySelector(\".btn-toggle\");\n// Select the stylesheet <link>\nconst theme = document.querySelector(\"#theme-link\");\n\n// Listen for a click on the button\nbtn.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n  // If the current URL contains \"ligh-theme.css\"\n  if (theme.getAttribute(\"href\") == \"light-theme.css\") {\n    // ... then switch it to \"dark-theme.css\"\n    theme.href = \"dark-theme.css\";\n  // Otherwise...\n  } else {\n    // ... switch it to \"light-theme.css\"\n    theme.href = \"light-theme.css\";\n  }\n});\n```\n\n[View Demo](https://codepen.io/adhuham/project/full/AqjdGV)\n\n#### Using Custom Properties\n\nWe\u00a0can\u00a0also\u00a0leverage the power of CSS\u00a0custom properties\u00a0to create a dark theme!\u00a0It helps us avoid having to write separate style rulesets for each theme, making it a lot faster to write styles and a lot easier to make changes to a theme if we need to.\n\nWe still might choose to swap a body class, and use that class to re-set custom properties:\n\n```\n// Select the button\nconst btn = document.querySelector(\".btn-toggle\");\n\u2028\n// Listen for a click on the button\nbtn.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n\u00a0 // Then toggle (add/remove) the .dark-theme class to the body\n\u00a0 document.body.classList.toggle(\"dark-theme\");\n});\n```\n\nFirst,\u00a0let\u2019s define the default light color values as custom properties on the body element:\n\n```\nbody {\n\u00a0 --text-color: #222;\n\u00a0 --bkg-color: #fff;\n\u00a0 --anchor-color: #0033cc;\n}\n```\n\nNow we can redefine those values on a\u00a0`.dark-theme`\u00a0body class just like we did in the first method:\n\n```\nbody.dark-theme {\n\u00a0 --text-color: #eee;\n\u00a0 --bkg-color: #121212;\n\u00a0 --anchor-color: #809fff;\n}\n```\n\nHere are our rulesets for the body and link elements using custom properties:\n\n```\nbody {\n\u00a0 color: var(--text-color);\n\u00a0 background: var(--bkg-color);\n}\na {\n\u00a0 color: var(--anchor-color);\n}\n```\n\nWe could just as well have defined our custom properties inside the document `:root`. That\u2019s totally legit and [even common practice](https://css-tricks.com/breaking-css-custom-properties-out-of-root-might-be-a-good-idea/). In that case, all the default theme styles definitions would go inside `:root { }` and all of the dark theme properties go inside\u00a0`:root.dark-mode { }`.\n\n#### Using Server-Side Scripts\n\nIf we\u2019re already working with a server-side language, say PHP,\u00a0then we can use it instead of JavaScript. This is a great approach if you prefer working directly in the markup.\n\n```\n<?php\n$themeClass = '';\nif (isset($_GET['theme']) && $_GET['theme'] == 'dark') {\n\u00a0 $themeClass = 'dark-theme';\n}\n\u2028\n$themeToggle = ($themeClass == 'dark-theme') ? 'light' : 'dark';\n?>\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<!-- etc. -->\n<body class=\"<?php echo $themeClass; ?>\">\n\u00a0 <a href=\"?theme=<?php echo $themeToggle; ?>\">Toggle Dark Mode</a>\n\u00a0 <!-- etc. -->\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nWe can have the user send a `GET` or `POST` request. Then,\u00a0we let our code\u00a0(PHP\u00a0in this case)\u00a0apply\u00a0the appropriate\u00a0body\u00a0class when the page is reloaded. I am using a `GET` request (URL params) for the purpose of this demonstration.\n\nAnd, yes, we\u00a0can\u00a0swap stylesheets just like we did in the second method.\n\n```\n<?php\n$themeStyleSheet = 'light-theme.css';\nif (isset($_GET['theme']) && $_GET['theme'] == 'dark') {\n\u00a0 $themeStyleSheet = 'dark-theme.css';\n}\n\u2028\n$themeToggle = ($themeStyleSheet == 'dark-theme.css') ? 'light' : 'dark';\n?>\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n\u00a0 <!-- etc. -->\n\u00a0 <link href=\"<?php echo $themeStyleSheet; ?>\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n</head>\n\u2028\n<body>\n\u00a0 <a href=\"?theme=<?php echo $themeToggle; ?>\">Toggle Dark Mode</a>\n\u00a0 <!-- etc. -->\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis method has an obvious downside: the page needs to be refreshed for the toggle\u00a0to take place. But a server-side solution like this is useful in persisting the user\u2019s theme choice across page reloads, as we will see later.\n\n---\n\n#### Which method should you choose?\n\nThe \u201cright\u201d method comes down to the requirements of your project. If you are doing a large project, for example, you might go with CSS properties to help wrangle a large codebase. On the other hand, if your project needs to support legacy browsers, then another approach will need to do instead.\n\nMoreover, there\u2019s nothing saying we can only use one method. Sometimes a combination of methods will be the most effective route. There may even be other possible methods than what we have discussed.\n\n---\n\n### Dark Mode at the Operating System Level\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve used a button to toggle between light and dark mode but we can simply let the user\u2019s operating system do that lifting for us. For example, many operating systems let users choose between light and dark themes directly in the system settings.\n\n![](https://i2.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MD5XiU_A.png?fit=1024%2C523&ssl=1)\n\nThe\u00a0\u201cGeneral\u201d\u00a0settings in MacOS System Preferences\n\n#### Pure CSS\n\nDetails\n\nFortunately, CSS has a\u00a0`prefers-color-scheme`\u00a0media query\u00a0which can be used to detect user\u2019s system color scheme preferences. It can have three possible values:\u00a0no preference,\u00a0light\u00a0and\u00a0dark. Read more about it\u00a0[on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme).\n\n```\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n\u00a0 /* Dark theme styles go here */\n}\n\u2028\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {\n\u00a0 /* Light theme styles go here */\n}\n```\n\nTo use it, we can put the dark theme styles inside the media query.\n\n```\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n\u00a0 body {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 color: #eee;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 background: #121212;\n\u00a0 }\n\u2028\n\u00a0 a {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 color: #809fff;\n\u00a0 }\n}\n```\n\nNow, if a user has\u00a0enabled\u00a0dark mode from\u00a0the\u00a0system settings, they\u00a0will\u00a0get the dark mode styles\u00a0by default.\u00a0We don\u2019t have to resort to JavaScript or server-side scripts to decide which mode to use. Heck, we don\u2019t even need the button anymore!\n\n#### JavaScript\n\nDetails\n\nWe can turn to\u00a0JavaScript to detect the\u00a0user\u2019s preferred\u00a0color scheme.\u00a0This is a lot like the first method we worked with, only we\u2019re using\u00a0`matchedMedia()`\u00a0to detect the user\u2019s preference.\n\n```\nconst prefersDarkScheme = window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)');nnif (prefersDarkScheme.matches) {n  document.body.classList.add('dark-theme');n} else {n  document.body.classList.remove('dark-theme');n}\n```\n\nThere is a downside to using JavaScript: there will likely be a quick flash of the light theme\u00a0as JavaScript is executed after the CSS.\u00a0That could be misconstrued as a bug.\n\nAnd, of course, we can swap stylesheets instead like we did in the second method. This time, we link up both stylesheets and use the media query to determine which one is applied.\n\n#### Overriding OS Settings\n\nWe just looked at how to account for a user\u2019s system-wide color scheme preferences. **But what if users want to override their system preference for a site?** Just because a user prefers dark mode for their OS doesn\u2019t always mean they prefer it on a website. That\u2019s why providing a way to manually override dark mode, despite the system settings, is a good idea.\n\nView Code\n\nLet\u2019s use the CSS custom properties approach to demonstrate how to do this. The idea is to define the custom properties for both themes like we did before, wrap dark styles up in the `prefers-color-scheme` media query, then define a `.light-theme` class inside of that we can use to override the dark mode properties, should the user want to toggle between the two modes.\n\n```\n/* Default colors */\nbody {\n\u00a0 --text-color: #222;\n\u00a0 --bkg-color: #fff;\n}\n/* Dark theme colors */\nbody.dark-theme {\n\u00a0 --text-color: #eee;\n\u00a0 --bkg-color: #121212;\n}\n\n/* Styles for users who prefer dark mode at the OS level */\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n\u00a0 /* defaults to dark theme */\n\u00a0 body {\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 --text-color: #eee;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 --bkg-color: #121212;\n\u00a0 }\n\u00a0 /* Override dark mode with light mode styles if the user decides to swap */\n\u00a0 body.light-theme {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 --text-color: #222;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 --bkg-color: #fff;\n\u00a0 }\n}\n```\n\nNow we can turn back to our trusty button to toggle between light and dark themes. **This way, we\u2019re respecting the OS color preference by default *and* allowing the user to manually switch themes.**\n\n```\n// Listen for a click on the button\u00a0\nbtn.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n\u00a0 // If the OS is set to dark mode...\n\u00a0 if (prefersDarkScheme.matches) {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 // ...then apply the .light-theme class to override those styles\n\u00a0 \u00a0 document.body.classList.toggle(\"light-theme\");\n\u00a0 \u00a0 // Otherwise...\n\u00a0 } else {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 // ...apply the .dark-theme class to override the default light styles\n\u00a0 \u00a0 document.body.classList.toggle(\"dark-theme\");\n\u00a0 }\n});\n```\n\n#### Browser Support\n\nThe `prefers-color-scheme` media query feature enjoys support by major browsers, including Chrome 76+, Firefox 67+, Chrome Android 76+, Safari 12.5+ (13+ on iOS), and Samsung Internet Browser. It doesn\u2019t support IE.\n\nThat\u2019s a promising amount of support! [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/%23feat=prefers-color-scheme) estimates 80.85% of user coverage.\n\nOperating systems that currently support dark mode include MacOS (Mojave or later), iOS (13.0+), Windows (10+), and Android (10+).\n\n---\n\n### Storing a User\u2019s Preference\n\nWhat we\u2019ve looked at so far definitely does what it says in the tin: swap themes based on an OS preference or a button click. This is great, but doesn\u2019t carry over when the user either visits another page on the site or reloads the current page.\n\nWe need to save the user\u2019s choice so that it will be applied consistently throughout the site and on subsequent visits. To do that, we can save the user\u2019s choice to the `localStorage` when the theme is toggled. Cookies are also well-suited for the job.\n\nLet\u2019s look at both approaches.\n\n#### **Using localStorage**\n\nWe have a script that saves the selected theme to localStorage when the toggle takes place. In other words, when the page is reloaded, the script fetches the choice from `localStorage` and applies it. JavaScript is often executed after CSS, so this approach is prone to a **\u201cflash of incorrect theme\u201d (FOIT)**.\n\nView Code\n\n```\n// Select the button\nconst btn = document.querySelector(\".btn-toggle\");\n// Select the theme preference from localStorage\nconst currentTheme = localStorage.getItem(\"theme\");\n\u2028\n// If the current theme in localStorage is \"dark\"...\nif (currentTheme == \"dark\") {\n\u00a0 // ...then use the .dark-theme class\n\u00a0 document.body.classList.add(\"dark-theme\");\n}\n\u2028\n// Listen for a click on the button\u00a0\nbtn.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n\u00a0 // Toggle the .dark-theme class on each click\n\u00a0 document.body.classList.toggle(\"dark-theme\");\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 // Let's say the theme is equal to light\n\u00a0 let theme = \"light\";\n\u00a0 // If the body contains the .dark-theme class...\n\u00a0 if (document.body.classList.contains(\"dark-theme\")) {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 // ...then let's make the theme dark\n\u00a0 \u00a0 theme = \"dark\";\n\u00a0 }\n\u00a0 // Then save the choice in localStorage\n\u00a0 localStorage.setItem(\"theme\", theme);\n});\n```\n\n#### Using Cookies with PHP\n\nTo avoid FLIC, we can use a server-side script like PHP. Instead of saving the user\u2019s theme preference in `localStorage`, we will create a cookie from JavaScript and save it there. But again, this may only be feasible if you\u2019re already working with a server-side language.\n\nView Code\n\n```\n// Select the button\nconst btn = document.querySelector(\".btn-toggle\");\n\u2028\n// Listen for a click on the button\u00a0\nbtn.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n\u00a0 // Toggle the .dark-theme class on the body\n\u00a0 document.body.classList.toggle(\"dark-theme\");\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 // Let's say the theme is equal to light\n\u00a0 let theme = \"light\";\n\u00a0 // If the body contains the .dark-theme class...\n\u00a0 if (document.body.classList.contains(\"dark-theme\")) {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 // ...then let's make the theme dark\n\u00a0 \u00a0 theme = \"dark\";\n\u00a0 }\n\u00a0 // Then save the choice in a cookie\n\u00a0 document.cookie = \"theme=\" + theme;\n});\n```\n\nWe can now check for the existence of that cookie and load the appropriate theme by applying the proper class to the `<body>` tag.\n\n```\n<?php\n$themeClass = '';\nif (!empty($_COOKIE['theme']) && $_COOKIE['theme'] == 'dark') {\n\u00a0 $themeClass = 'dark-theme';\n}\n?>\n\u2028\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<!-- etc. -->\n<body class=\"<?php echo $themeClass; ?>\">\n<!-- etc. -->\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nHere is how to do that using the separate stylesheets method:\n\n```\n<?php\n$themeStyleSheet = 'light-theme.css';\nif (!empty($_COOKIE['theme']) && $_COOKIE['theme'] == 'dark') {\n\u00a0 $themeStyleSheet = 'dark-theme.css';\n}\n?>\n\u2028\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n\u00a0 <!-- etc. -->\n\u00a0 <link href=\"<?php echo $themeStyleSheet; ?>\" rel=\"stylesheet\" id=\"theme-link\">\n</head>\n<!-- etc. -->\n```\n\nIf your website has user accounts \u2014 like a place to log in and manage profile stuff \u2014 that\u2019s also a great place to save theme preferences. Send those to the database where user account details are stored. Then, when the user logs in, fetch the theme from the database and apply it to the page using PHP (or whatever server-side script).\n\nThere are various ways to do this. In this example, I am fetching the user\u2019s theme preference from the database and saving it in a session variable at the time of login.\n\n```\n<?php\n// Login action\nif (!empty($_POST['login'])) {\n\u00a0 // etc.\n\u2028\n\u00a0 // If the uuser is authenticated...\n\u00a0 if ($loginSuccess) {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 // ... save their theme preference to a session variable\n\u00a0 \u00a0 $_SESSION['user_theme'] = $userData['theme'];\n\u00a0 }\n}\n\u2028\n// Pick the session variable first if it's set; otherwise pick the cookie\n$themeChoice = $_SESSION['user_theme'] ?? $_COOKIE['theme'] ?? null;\n$themeClass = '';\nif ($themeChoice == 'dark') {\n\u00a0 $themeClass = 'dark-theme';\n}\n?>\n\u2028\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<!-- etc. -->\n<body class=\"<?php echo $themeClass; ?>\">\n<!-- etc. -->\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nI am using PHP\u2019s [null coalesce operator](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration70.new-features.php#migration70.new-features.null-coalesce-op) (`??`) to decide where to pick the theme preference: from the session or from the cookie. If the user is logged in, the value of the session variable is taken instead that of the cookie. And if the user is not logged in or has logged out, the value of cookie is taken.\n\n---\n\n### Handling User Agent Styles\n\nTo inform the browser UA stylesheet about the system color scheme preferences and tell it which color schemes are supported in the page, we can use the `color-scheme` meta tag.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say the page should support both \u201cdark\u201d and \u201clight\u201d themes. We can put both of them as values in the meta tag, separated by spaces. If we only want to support a \u201clight\u201d theme, then we only need to use \u201clight\u201d as the value. This is discussed in a [CSSWG GitHub issue](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3299), where it was originally proposed.\n\n```\n<meta name=\"color-scheme\" content=\"dark light\">\n```\n\nWhen this meta tag is added, the browser takes the user\u2019s color scheme preferences into consideration when rendering UA-controlled elements of the page (like a `<button>`). It renders colors for the root background, form controls, and spell-check features (as well as any other UA-controlled styles) based on the user\u2019s preference.\n\n![](https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/jwtAqLmj.jpeg?fit=1024%2C341&ssl=1)\n\n[Source](https://dark-mode.glitch.me)\n\nAlthough themes are manually styled for the most part (which overrides the UA styles), informing the browser about the supported themes helps to avoid even the slightest chance of a potential FOIT situation. This is true for those occasions where HTML has rendered but CSS is still waiting to load.\n\nWe can also set this in CSS:\n\n```\n:root {\n  color-scheme: light dark; /* both supported */\n}\n```\n\n![](https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/color-scheme-comparison.png?fit=1008%2C1024&ssl=1)\n\nvia [Jim Nielsen](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2020/color-scheme-property/)\n\nAt the time of writing, the `color-scheme` property [lacks broad browser support](https://caniuse.com/?feat=mdn-html_elements_meta_name_color-scheme), though Safari and Chrome both support it.\n\n---\n\n### Combining all the things!\n\nLet\u2019s combine everything and create a working demo that:\n\n1. Automatically loads a dark or light theme based on system preferences\n2. Allows the user to manually override their system preference\n3. Maintains the user\u2019s preferred theme on page reloads\n\n#### Using JavaScript & Local Storage\n\n```\n// Select the button\nconst btn = document.querySelector(\".btn-toggle\");\n// Check for dark mode preference at the OS level\nconst prefersDarkScheme = window.matchMedia(\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\");\n\u2028\n// Get the user's theme preference from local storage, if it's available\nconst currentTheme = localStorage.getItem(\"theme\");\n// If the user's preference in localStorage is dark...\nif (currentTheme == \"dark\") {\n\u00a0 // ...let's toggle the .dark-theme class on the body\n\u00a0 document.body.classList.toggle(\"dark-mode\");\n// Otherwise, if the user's preference in localStorage is light...\n} else if (currentTheme == \"light\") {\n\u00a0 // ...let's toggle the .light-theme class on the body\n\u00a0 document.body.classList.toggle(\"light-mode\");\n}\n\u2028\n// Listen for a click on the button\u00a0\nbtn.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n\u00a0 // If the user's OS setting is dark and matches our .dark-mode class...\n\u00a0 if (prefersDarkScheme.matches) {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 // ...then toggle the light mode class\n\u00a0 \u00a0 document.body.classList.toggle(\"light-mode\");\n\u00a0 \u00a0 // ...but use .dark-mode if the .light-mode class is already on the body,\n\u00a0 \u00a0 var theme = document.body.classList.contains(\"light-mode\") ? \"light\" : \"dark\";\n\u00a0 } else {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 // Otherwise, let's do the same thing, but for .dark-mode\n\u00a0 \u00a0 document.body.classList.toggle(\"dark-mode\");\n\u00a0 \u00a0 var theme = document.body.classList.contains(\"dark-mode\") ? \"dark\" : \"light\";\n\u00a0 }\n\u00a0 // Finally, let's save the current preference to localStorage to keep using it\n\u00a0 localStorage.setItem(\"theme\", theme);\n});\n```\n\n#### Using PHP & Cookies\n\n```\n<?php\n$themeClass = '';\nif (!empty($_COOKIE['theme'])) {\n\u00a0 if ($_COOKIE['theme'] == 'dark') {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 $themeClass = 'dark-theme';\n\u00a0 } else if ($_COOKIE['theme'] == 'light') {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 $themeClass = 'light-theme';\n\u00a0 } \u00a0\n}\n?>\n\u2028\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<!-- etc. -->\n<body class=\"<?php echo $themeClass; ?>\">\n<!-- etc. -->\n<script>\n\u00a0 const btn = document.querySelector(\".btn-toggle\");\n\u00a0 const prefersDarkScheme = window.matchMedia(\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\");\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 btn.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 if (prefersDarkScheme.matches) {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 document.body.classList.toggle(\"light-mode\");\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 var theme = document.body.classList.contains(\"light-mode\") ? \"light\" : \"dark\";\n\u00a0 \u00a0 } else {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 document.body.classList.toggle(\"dark-mode\");\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 var theme = document.body.classList.contains(\"dark-mode\") ? \"dark\" : \"light\";\n\u00a0 \u00a0 }\n\u00a0 \u00a0 document.cookie = \"theme=\" + theme;\n\u00a0 });\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n---\n\n### Design Considerations\n\nI often hear that implementing dark mode is easier than designing one. While I\u2019ll refrain from judgement, let\u2019s look at some considerations for designing a dark theme.\n\nYou already know the basic task: swap lighter color values for darker ones and vice versa. But there are some UI elements and enhancements that are more nuanced and require more attention. Let\u2019s take a look at those.\n\n#### **Dark Mode Images**\n\nA good rule is to decrease the brightness and contrast of images a bit so that it looks comfortable to the eyes when it\u2019s against a dark background. A super bright image on a super dark background can be jarring and dimming the image reduces some of that heavy contrast.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-optimized-1.png?resize=1102%2C780&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-normal-1.png?resize=1102%2C780&ssl=1)\n\nThe CSS `filter()` function is more than capable of handling this for us:\n\n```\n/* Apply the filter directly on the body tag */\nbody.dark-theme img {\n\u00a0 filter: brightness(.8) contrast(1.2);\n}\n\u2028\n/* Or apply it via media query */\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n\u00a0 img {\n\u00a0 \u00a0 filter: brightness(.8) contrast(1.2);\n\u00a0 }\n}\n```\n\nWe can do the same sort of thing directly in the markup using the `<picture>` element to load different versions of an image:\n\n```\n<picture>\n\u00a0 <!-- Use this image if the user's OS setting is light or unset -->\n\u00a0 <source srcset=\"photo-light.png\" media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light) or (prefers-color-scheme: no-preference)\">\n\u00a0 <!-- Use this image if the user's OS setting is dark -->\n\u00a0 <source srcset=\"photo-dark.png\" media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\">\n</picture>\n```\n\nThe downside here is that it requires supplying two files where we only have to deal with one when using CSS. This also doesn\u2019t fully account for the user toggling the color theme on the site.\n\n#### Dark Mode Shadows\n\nDark mode shadows are tricky. If we simply invert a dark shadow using light colors, then we get this funky thing with a light shadow on a dark background\u2026 and it\u2019s not a good look.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/white-shadow-fixed-2.png?resize=726%2C386&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/white-shadow-2.png?resize=726%2C386&ssl=1)\n\nIt\u2019s possible to use a dark shadow in dark mode, but the background color has to be \u201clight\u201d enough (like a dark gray) to provide enough contrast to actually see the shadow against it.\n\n> \ud83d\udd25 When implementing dark mode, don\u2019t throw away the visual cues in the light version by naively inverting the color scheme.  \n>   \n> Close elements should still be lighter and distant elements should still be darker \u2013 even in a dark UI. [pic.twitter.com/RNxgIppDmn](https://t.co/RNxgIppDmn)\n>\n> \u2014 Steve Schoger (@steveschoger) [July 16, 2019](https://twitter.com/steveschoger/status/1151160261170126850?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nUse opacity to convey depth, with high opacity regions having a lower depth. That\u2019s to say, elements that have a higher elevation should have a lower opacity than elements that are \u201ccloser\u201d in depth to the background.\n\n![](https://i1.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/depth-4.png?fit=1024%2C375&ssl=1)\n\nDifferent shades of color create different perceptions of \u201cdepth\u201d\n\n#### Dark Mode Typography\n\nThe trick here is a lot like images: we\u2019ve gotta balance the contrast. Use too heavy of a font and we get blaring text that\u2019s makes us want to move away from the screen. Use too light of a font and we\u2019ll strain our eyes while inching toward the screen to get a closer look.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/typo-thick-3.png?resize=1516%2C1832&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/typo-thin-4.png?resize=1137%2C1374&ssl=1)\n\nThe balance is somewhere in the middle. [Robin has a nice write-up](https://css-tricks.com/dark-mode-and-variable-fonts/) where he suggests a small bit of CSS that makes a big difference in legibility.\n\n#### Dark Mode Icons\n\nIcons fall into this \u201ctricky\u201d category because they\u2019re sort of a cross between text and images. If we\u2019re working with SVG icons, though, we can change the fill with CSS. On the other hand, if we\u2019re using font icons, we can simply change the color property instead.\n\n```\n/* SVG icon */\nbody.dark-theme svg.icon path {\n\u00a0 fill: #efefef;\n}\n/* Font icon (using Font Awesome as an example) */\nbody.dark-theme .fa {\n\u00a0 color: #efefef;\n}\n```\n\nA lot of the same design considerations that are true for text, are also generally applicable to icons. For example, we ought to avoid using full white and heavy outlines.\n\n#### Dark Mode Colors\n\nPure white text on a pure black background will look jarring. The trick here is to use an off-white for the text and off-black for the background. [Material Design Guidelines](https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html) for example recommends `#121212` for the background.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bkg-fixed-3.png?resize=1137%2C1374&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bkg-3.png?resize=1137%2C1374&ssl=1)\n\n#### Dark Mode Color Palettes\n\nWe\u2019ve seen the difference using off-white and off-black colors makes for text and images. Let\u2019s expand on that a bit with tips on how to develop a full color palette.\n\nMost things boil down to one thing: **contrast**. That\u2019s why the first tip before settling on any color is to run ideas through a contrast checker to ensure color ratios conform to WCAG\u2019s guidelines for at least a AA rating, [which is a contrast ratio of 4.5:1](https://css-tricks.com/understanding-web-accessibility-color-contrast-guidelines-and-ratios/).\n\nThat means desaturated colors are our friends when working with a dark mode design. They help prevent overbearingly bright images and still give us plenty of room to create an effective contrast ratio.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/desaturate-fixed-4.png?resize=936%2C868&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/desaturate-3.png?resize=936%2C868&ssl=1)\n\nNext, remember that accent colors are meant to be enhancements. They\u2019re likely brighter than the dark theme background color, so using them like a primary color or the background color of a large container is just as jarring and hard on the eyes as a bright image or heavy white text.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/color-blob-fixed-1.png?resize=800%2C740&ssl=1)![](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/color-blob-2.png?resize=800%2C740&ssl=1)\n\nIf contrast is the balance we\u2019re trying to strike, then remember that dark mode is more than blacks and grays. What about dark blue background with pale yellow text? Or dark brown with tan? There\u2019s an entire (and [growing](https://css-tricks.com/the-expanding-gamut-of-color-on-the-web/)) spectrum of color out there and we can leverage any part of it to fuel creativity.\n\nA few examples of colors that are dark without resorting to full-on black:\n\n#232B32\n\n#152028\n\n#202945\n\n[Material Design\u2019s guidelines on dark mode](https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html) is a handy resource on best practices for dark mode design. It\u2019s definitely worth a read for more tips to keep in mind.\n\n### Dark Mode in the Wild\n\n- ![](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-03-at-3.04.48-PM-1024x782.png?resize=1024%2C782&ssl=1)\n\n  DuckDuckGo\n- ![](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-03-at-3.03.46-PM-1024x782.png?resize=1024%2C782&ssl=1)\n\n  Twitter\n- ![](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-03-at-3.02.30-PM-1024x782.png?resize=1024%2C782&ssl=1)\n\n  YouTube\n- ![](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-03-at-3.16.55-PM-1024x782.png?resize=1024%2C782&ssl=1)\n\n  Slack\n- ![](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-03-at-3.03.23-PM-1024x782.png?resize=1024%2C782&ssl=1)\n\n  Slack\n- ![](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-03-at-3.03.36-PM-1024x782.png?resize=1024%2C782&ssl=1)\n\n  Dropbox Paper\n- ![](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-03-at-3.02.20-PM-1024x782.png?resize=1024%2C782&ssl=1)\n\n  Simplenote\n\nYouTube uses the CSS variables technique. They\u2019ve defined all their colors in variables under the html selector while dark mode colors are defined under `html:not(.style-scope)[dark]`. When dark mode is enabled, YouTube adds a `dark=\"true\"` attribute to the `<html>` tag. This is what they use to override the variables defined in the HTML.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/b0FBHzyc-1-e1593210129104-1024x991.png?resize=1024%2C991&ssl=1)\n\nYouTube adds `dark=true` attribute to the `<html>` when it switches to the dark mode.\n\nIn the wild, the CSS custom properties approach seems to be most popular. It\u2019s being used by Dropbox Paper, Slack, and Facebook.\n\n[Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/) uses the class-swapping method where all light style rules are descendants of a `.theme-light` parent class and all the dark styles fall under a `.theme-dark` class. When the theme is toggled, the appropriate class is applied to the `<body>` tag.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/UsbhAk5g-1-e1593210246404-1024x1003.png?resize=1024%2C1003&ssl=1)\n\nSimplenote uses two classes: `.light-theme` and `.dark-theme` to style the themes.\n\nTwitter goes the extra mile and offers several themes to choose from: \u201cDefault,\u201d \u201cDim,\u201d and \u201cLights out.\u201d The \u201cDim\u201d option employs dark blue for a background color. Compare that to \u201cLights out\u201d which uses a stark black.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/0cDi_Rnw-1024x441.png?resize=1024%2C441&ssl=1)\n\nTwitter offers three themes to choose from.\n\n---\n\n### Dark mode or no dark mode? That is the question.\n\nThere are perfectly valid reasons on both sides. Some of those reasons even go beyond the scope of user experience and include things like timing, budget and resources.\n\nWhile being considerate of why you might not want to implement a dark mode, here are reasons why you might want to have one:\n\n- It\u2019s cool and trendy (although that\u2019s not a reason alone to do it)\n- It enhances accessibility by supporting users who are sensitive to eye strain in starkly bright themes.\n- It allows users to decide the most comfortable way to consume content while providing us a way to maintain control over the look and feel of things. Remember, we want to [beat the Reader Mode button](https://css-tricks.com/reader-mode-the-button-to-beat/)!\n- It helps to preserve battery life for devices with OLED screen where brighter colors consume more energy.\n- It\u2019s extremely popular and appears to be going nowhere. It\u2019s possible that your users who prefer a dark mode (like me!) will expect your site to have one. Might as well be ready for it.",
