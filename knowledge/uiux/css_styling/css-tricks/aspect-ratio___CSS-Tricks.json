Browsers do some fancy aspect ratio calculations on\nreplaced content\nlike images. So, if an image has, say, a width of 500px, the browser flexes its CSS layout algorithms to maintain the image\u2019s\nintrinsic\nor \u201cnatural\u201d dimensions\n. The\naspect-ratio\nproperty can be used to effectively override those natural dimensions.\nBut\nnon-replaced content\ndoes not have a natural proportion. That\u2019s most of the stuff we work with, like divs. Rather than try to maintain the element\u2019s natural proportions,\naspect-ratio\nsets a \u201cpreferred\u201d sizing.\nNow, the spec currently notes that older CSS specifications, notably CSS 2.1, does not contain a clear distinction between replaced and non-replaced content. That means we could see some additional special cases added to the spec to help clarify them. For the time being, we\u2019re seeing browsers rolling out support for setting preferred aspect ratios on replaced and non-replaced separately, where some of the browsers with early support behind an experimental flag might only support\naspect-ratio\nfor non-replaced content. Definitely worth keeping an eye on the\nbrowser support\nas it evolves.\nIt works on its own without specifying a\nwidth\nor\nheight\nSo, yeah, we can simply drop it on an element like this:\n.element {\n  aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;\n}\n\u2026and the element\u2019s default\nwidth: auto\nkicks in implicitly to set the element\u2019s dimensions.\nView live demo on CodePen\nIt changes when\nwidth\nor\nheight\nare on the same element\nLet\u2019s say we have an element with a width of\n300px\nand an\naspect-ratio\nof\n3/1\n.\n.element {\n  aspect-ratio: 3 / 1;\n  width: 300px;\n}\nBy nature,\naspect-ratio\nwants to calculate the element\u2019s dimensions on its own and will do so based on the context where it\u2019s used. But with that\nwidth\ntossed in, it tells\naspect-ratio\nto calculate the element\u2019s aspect ratio box using\n300px\nas the width. As a result, it\u2019s like we\u2019ve just written:\n.element {\n  height: 100px;\n  width: 300px;\n}\nThis makes sense! Remember, when no\nwidth\nor\nheight\nare specified, the browser assumes those are\nauto\nand goes from there. When we provide explicit\nwidth\nand\nheight\nvalues, those are what get used.\nIt\u2019s ignored in some situations\nThis is where things get a little mind-bendy because there are cases where\naspect-ratio\nis overlooked or it\u2019s calculations are affected by other properties. That includes:\nWhen both\nwidth\nand\nheight\nare declared on the element\nWe just saw how declaring either\nwidth\nor\nheight\non and element will affect the calculation of\naspect-ratio\n. But if the element already has\nboth\na\nwidth\nand\nheight\n, those get used instead of\naspect-ratio\n. It requires both properties to override\naspect-ratio\n; setting either\nheight\nor\nwidth\nalone will not break the element\u2019s aspect ratio.\naspect-ratio\nis ignored when both\nwidth\nand\nheight\nare set on the same element.\nMakes senes, right? If using either\nwidth\nor\nheight\nforces the\naspect-ratio\nto use that value in the calculation, then it logically follows that using both would completely override\naspect-ratio\naltogether since both values are already provided and set.\nWhen content breaks out of the ratio\nSimply put, if you have an element with an aspect ratio and the content is so long such that it forces the element to expand, then the element will expand. And if the element expands, its dimensions change and, thus, no more aspect ratio. This is why the spec says the property sets the \u201cpreferred\u201d aspect ratio. It\u2019s preferred, but not prescribed.\nDon\u2019t like how that works? Setting\nmin-height: 0;\non the element will allow the content to overflow the preferred aspect ratio instead of expanding it.\nView live demo on CodePen\nWhen it \u201closes\u201d to\nmin-*\nand\nmax-*\nproperties\nWe just sort of saw how that works, right? When content exceeds the dimensions of the box, the\naspect-ratio\nis effectively gone because the box expands with the content. We can override that with\nmin-width: 0\n.\nThat\u2019s because all of the\nmin-*\nand\nmax-*\nproperties typically battle\nwidth\nand\nheight\nfor supremacy in the war over Box Model calculations. For example:\n.element {\n  min-width: 500px; /* \ud83c\udfc6 Winner! */\n  width: 100px;\n}\nBut:\n.element {\n  min-width: 500px;\n  width: 700px; /* \ud83c\udfc6 Winner! */\n}\nThat\u2019s because\nmin-width\nis either preventing\nwidth\nfrom going below a specific value, or it is ignored because the\nwidth\nhas set already set the element beyond the minimum width it needs to be. The same thing goes for\nmin-height\n,\nmax-width\n, and\nmax-height\n.\nThe point of all this: if we set both a\nmin-*\nor\nmax-*\nproperty on the same element as\naspect-ratio\nand\nthey \u201cwin\u201d over\nwidth\nor\nheight\n, then those will override\naspect-ratio\n. Told you it was a little mind-bendy. \ud83e\udd2f\nUse cases\nReplaced elements like images or videos already have an intrinsic aspect ratio, therefore when they grow or shrink, they maintain their aspect ratio, but non-replaced elements don\u2019t have that luxury and sometimes you need that behavior for them.\nHere are some examples where\naspect-ratio\nbecomes handy.\nResponsive iframes\nA very common use case is when you want to embed an iframe for displaying a video from another site like YouTube. In this case if you set the width to 100% and you set a height, the video is going to be deformed.\nIn order to have a responsive iframe that preserves its aspect ratio you can do as following:\niframe {\n  aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: auto;\n}\nIf the iframe has width and height attributes set like this:\n<iframe src=\"https://example.com\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"></iframe>\n\u2026then you can automatically set the\naspect-ratio\nlike this:\niframe[width][height] {\n  aspect-ratio: attr(width) / attr(height);\n}\nHero images\nSetting a background-image to an element doesn\u2019t have any effect on the size of that element. So for creating a hero image, if the image is in the background, you need to set a height on the element and having a fixed height is not very responsive!\nHere you can use aspect-ratio property In order to have a hero that preserve the aspect ratio of its\nbackground-image\n:\n.hero {\n  aspect-ratio: 4 / 3;\n  background: url(background.png);\n}\nConsistency in a grid layout\nImagine, In a flexbox or a grid layout with auto-fill mechanism, you may want items to stay square, but items width and height can shrink or grow based on their content or their parent\u2019s size and as a result it\u2019s most likely that items don\u2019t stay square.\nSetting\naspect-ratio\nto\n1 / 1\nchanges the height dynamically while your item\u2019s width scales:\n.grid-container {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(180px, 1fr));\n}\n\n.grid-item {\n  aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;\n}\nIn the following image gallery, since images have random sizes, the\naspect-ratio\nproperty is used in order to keep their height consistent. Remove aspect-ratio on the item list and see the effect.\nAlso, with using\nobject-fit\n, you can fit the images into the right dimensions.\nBrowser support\nDealing with legacy browser support\nBefore having this property one way of dealing with this issue was\npadded-box technique\nand now thanks to CSS\n@supports\nwe can use that technique for older browsers.\nIn the following example, the pseudo-element tactic is used to add fallback for aspect ratio property in older browsers:\n.element {\n  aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;\n}\n\n@supports not (aspect-ratio: 1 / 1) {\n  .element::before {\n    float: left;\n    padding-top: 100%;\n    content: \"\";\n  }\n\n  .element::after {\n    display: block;\n    content: \"\";\n    clear: both;\n  }\n}\nMore information\naspect ratio\nArticle\non\n\n    May 28, 2020\nA First Look at `aspect-ratio`\nChris Coyier\naspect ratio\nvideo\nArticle\non\n\n    Jan 8, 2021\n`aspect-ratio` is going to deprecate FitVids\nChris Coyier\naspect ratio\nunits\nLink\non\n\n    Mar 13, 2019\nDesigning An Aspect Ratio Unit For CSS\nGeoff Graham\naspect ratio\nArticle\non\n\n    Jun 8, 2017\nAspect Ratio Boxes\nChris Coyier\ngrid\nArticle\non\n\n    Nov 15, 2017\nAspect Ratios for Grid Items\nChris Coyier\naspect ratio\nimages\nArticle\non\n\n    Jun 6, 2019\nWhat if we got aspect-ratio sized images by doing almost nothing?\nChris Coyier\nRelated properties\nlayout\nAlmanac\non\n\n    Sep 5, 2011\nheight\n.element { height: 500px; }\nSara Cope\nAlmanac\non\nmax-height\n.element { max-height: 3rem; }\nSara Cope\nAlmanac\non\nmax-width\n.element { max-width: 100%; }\nSara Cope\nAlmanac\non\nmin-height\n.element { min-height: 100vh; }\nSara Cope\nAlmanac\non\nmin-width\n.element { min-width: 300px; }\nSara Cope\nlayout\nwidth\nAlmanac\non\n\n    Sep 6, 2011\nwidth\n.elment { width: 50%; }\nSara Cope",

But if the element already has *both* a `width` and `height`, those get used instead of `aspect-ratio`.

If using either `width` or `height` forces the `aspect-ratio` to use that value in the calculation, then it logically follows that using both would completely override `aspect-ratio` altogether since both values are already provided and set.\n\n#### When content breaks out of the ratio\n\nSimply put, if you have an element with an aspect ratio and the content is so long such that it forces the element to expand, then the element will expand.

When content exceeds the dimensions of the box, the `aspect-ratio` is effectively gone because the box expands with the content. We can override that with `min-width: 0`.\n\nThat\u2019s because all of the `min-*` and `max-*` properties typically battle `width` and `height` for supremacy in the war over Box Model calculations. For example:\n\n```\n.element {\n  min-width: 500px; /* \ud83c\udfc6 Winner! */\n  width: 100px;\n}\n```\n\nBut:\n\n```\n.element {\n  min-width: 500px;\n  width: 700px; /* \ud83c\udfc6 Winner! */\n}\n```\n\nThat\u2019s because `min-width` is either preventing `width` from going below a specific value, or it is ignored because the `width` has set already set the element beyond the minimum width it needs to be. The same thing goes for `min-height`, `max-width`, and `max-height`.\n\nThe point of all this: if we set both a `min-*` or `max-*` property on the same element as `aspect-ratio` *and* they \u201cwin\u201d over `width` or `height`, then those will override `aspect-ratio`. Told you it was a little mind-bendy. \ud83e\udd2f\n\n### Use cases\n\nReplaced elements like images or videos already have an intrinsic aspect ratio, therefore when they grow or shrink, they maintain their aspect ratio, but non-replaced elements don\u2019t have that luxury and sometimes you need that behavior for them.\n\nHere are some examples where\u00a0`aspect-ratio`\u00a0becomes handy.\n\nResponsive iframes \n\nA very common use case is when you want to embed an iframe for displaying a video from another site like YouTube. In this case if you set the width to 100% and you set a height, the video is going to be deformed.\n\nIn order to have a responsive iframe that preserves its aspect ratio you can do as following:\n\n```\niframe {\n  aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: auto;\n}\n```\n\nIf the iframe has width and height attributes set like this:\n\n```\n<iframe src=\"https://example.com\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\u2026then you can automatically set the `aspect-ratio` like this:\n\n```\niframe[width][height] {\n  aspect-ratio: attr(width) / attr(height);\n}\n```\n\nHero images \n\nSetting a background-image to an element doesn\u2019t have any effect on the size of that element. So for creating a hero image, if the image is in the background, you need to set a height on the element and having a fixed height is not very responsive!\n\nHere you can use aspect-ratio property In order to have a hero that preserve the aspect ratio of its `background-image`:\n\n```\n.hero {\n  aspect-ratio: 4 / 3;\n  background: url(background.png);\n}\n```\n\nConsistency in a grid layout \n\nImagine, In a flexbox or a grid layout with auto-fill mechanism, you may want items to stay square, but items width and height can shrink or grow based on their content or their parent\u2019s size and as a result it\u2019s most likely that items don\u2019t stay square.\n\nSetting\u00a0`aspect-ratio`\u00a0to\u00a0`1 / 1`\u00a0changes the height dynamically while your item\u2019s width scales:\n\n```\n.grid-container {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(180px, 1fr));\n}\n\n.grid-item {\n  aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;\n}\n```\n\nIn the following image gallery, since images have random sizes, the `aspect-ratio` property is used in order to keep their height consistent. Remove aspect-ratio on the item list and see the effect.\n\nAlso, with using\u00a0[`object-fit`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/object-fit/), you can fit the images into the right dimensions.\n\n### Browser support\n\n#### Dealing with legacy browser support\n\nBefore having this property one way of dealing with this issue was\u00a0[padded-box technique](https://css-tricks.com/aspect-ratio-boxes/)\u00a0and now thanks to CSS\u00a0[`@supports`](https://css-tricks.com/how-supports-works/)\u00a0we can use that technique for older browsers.\n\nIn the following example, the pseudo-element tactic is used to add fallback for aspect ratio property in older browsers:\n\n```\n.element {\n  aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;\n}\n\n@supports not (aspect-ratio: 1 / 1) {\n  .element::before {\n    float: left;\n    padding-top: 100%;\n    content: \"\";\n  }\n\n  .element::after {\n    display: block;\n    content: \"\";\n    clear: both;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### More information\n\n[aspect ratio](https://css-tricks.com/tag/aspect-ratio/)\n\n**Article**\non\nMay 28, 2020 \n\n### [A First Look at `aspect-ratio`](https://css-tricks.com/a-first-look-at-aspect-ratio/)\n\n[![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/cache/breeze-extra/gravatars/41a6f9778d12dfedcc7ec3727d64a12491d75d9a65d4b9323feb075391ae6795)](https://css-tricks.com/author/chriscoyier/) \n[Chris Coyier](https://css-tricks.com/author/chriscoyier/)\n\n[aspect ratio](https://css-tricks.com/tag/aspect-ratio/) [video](https://css-tricks.com/tag/video/)\n\n**Article**\non\nJan 8, 2021 \n\n### [`aspect-ratio` is going to deprecate FitVids](https://css-tricks.com/aspect-ratio-is-going-to-deprecate-fitvids/)\n\n[![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/cache/breeze-extra/gravatars/41a6f9778d12dfedcc7ec3727d64a12491d75d9a65d4b9323feb075391ae6795)](https://css-tricks.com/author/chriscoyier/) \n[Chris Coyier](https://css-tricks.com/author/chriscoyier/)\n\n[aspect ratio](https://css-tricks.com/tag/aspect-ratio/) [units](https://css-tricks.com/tag/units/)\n\n**Link**\non\nMar 13, 2019 \n\n### [Designing An Aspect Ratio Unit For CSS](https://css-tricks.com/designing-an-aspect-ratio-unit-for-css/)\n\n[![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/cache/breeze-extra/gravatars/a8e040142716a4b44d014d80fbcf99c635b1d8faabfe469b6954a8ef2f168595)](https://css-tricks.com/author/geoffgraham/) \n[Geoff Graham](https://css-tricks.com/author/geoffgraham/)\n\n[aspect ratio](https://css-tricks.com/tag/aspect-ratio/)\n\n**Article**\non\nJun 8, 2017 \n\n### [Aspect Ratio Boxes](https://css-tricks.com/aspect-ratio-boxes/)\n\n[![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/cache/breeze-extra/gravatars/41a6f9778d12dfedcc7ec3727d64a12491d75d9a65d4b9323feb075391ae6795)](https://css-tricks.com/author/chriscoyier/) \n[Chris Coyier](https://css-tricks.com/author/chriscoyier/)\n\n[grid](https://css-tricks.com/tag/grid/)\n\n**Article**\non\nNov 15, 2017 \n\n### [Aspect Ratios for Grid Items](https://css-tricks.com/aspect-ratios-grid-items/)\n\n[![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/cache/breeze-extra/gravatars/41a6f9778d12dfedcc7ec3727d64a12491d75d9a65d4b9323feb075391ae6795)](https://css-tricks.com/author/chriscoyier/) \n[Chris Coyier](https://css-tricks.com/author/chriscoyier/)\n\n[aspect ratio](https://css-tricks.com/tag/aspect-ratio/) [images](https://css-tricks.com/tag/images/)\n\n**Article**\non\nJun 6, 2019 \n\n### [What if we got aspect-ratio sized images by doing almost nothing?](https://css-tricks.com/what-if-we-got-aspect-ratio-sized-images-by-doing-almost-nothing/)\n\n[![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/cache/breeze-extra/gravatars/41a6f9778d12dfedcc7ec3727d64a12491d75d9a65d4b9323feb075391ae6795)](https://css-tricks.com/author/chriscoyier/) \n[Chris Coyier](https://css-tricks.com/author/chriscoyier/)\n\n### Related properties\n\n[layout](https://css-tricks.com/tag/layout/)\n\n**Almanac**\non\nSep 5, 2011 \n\n### [height](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/h/height/)\n\n[`.element { height: 500px;
