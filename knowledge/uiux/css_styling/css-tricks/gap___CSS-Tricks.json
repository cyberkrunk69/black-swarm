The extra cruft at the start and end is never an issue!\n\nBut, hey, if you *want* to have space around the items while using `gap`, put `padding` around the container like this:\n\n```\n.container {\n\u00a0 display: flex;\n\u00a0 gap: 1rem;\n\u00a0 padding: 1rem;\n}\n```\n\n#### Gutter size is not always equal to the gap value\n\nThe `gap` property is not the only thing that can put space between items.
