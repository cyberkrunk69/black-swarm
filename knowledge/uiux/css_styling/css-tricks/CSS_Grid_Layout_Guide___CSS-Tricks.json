  "content": "Our comprehensive guide to CSS grid, focusing on all the settings both for the grid parent container and the grid child elements.\nReference this guide a lot?\nHere\u2019s a high-resolution image you can print!\nIntroduction\nCSS Grid Layout (aka \u201cGrid\u201d or \u201cCSS Grid\u201d), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that, compared to any web layout system of the past, completely changes the way we design user interfaces. CSS has always been used to layout our web pages, but it\u2019s never done a very good job of it. First, we used tables, then floats, positioning and inline-block, but all of these methods were essentially hacks and left out a lot of important functionality (vertical centering, for instance).\nCSS Flexbox\nis also a very great layout tool, but its one-directional flow has\ndifferent use cases\n\u2014 and they actually\nwork together\nquite well! CSS Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we\u2019ve all been hacking our way around for as long as we\u2019ve been making websites.\nThe intention of this guide is to present CSS Grid concepts as they exist in the latest version of the specification. So, we will not cover\nthe out-of-date Internet Explorer syntax\nor other historical hacks.\nKey Terms\nBefore diving into the concepts of CSS Grid, it\u2019s important to understand the terminology. Since the terms involved here are all kinda conceptually similar, it\u2019s easy to confuse them with one another if you don\u2019t first memorize their meanings defined by the CSS Grid specification. But don\u2019t worry, there aren\u2019t many of them.\nGrid Container\nThe element on which\ndisplay: grid\nis applied. It\u2019s the direct parent of all the grid items. In this example\ncontainer\nis the grid container.\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <div class=\"item item-1\"> </div>\n  <div class=\"item item-2\"> </div>\n  <div class=\"item item-3\"> </div>\n</div>\nGrid Item\nThe children (i.e.\ndirect\ndescendants) of the grid container. Here the\nitem\nelements are grid items, but\nsub-item\nisn\u2019t.\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <div class=\"item\"> </div>\n  <div class=\"item\">\n    <p class=\"sub-item\"> </p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"item\"> </div>\n</div>\nGrid Line\nThe dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be either vertical (\u201ccolumn grid lines\u201d) or horizontal (\u201crow grid lines\u201d) and reside on either side of a row or column. Here the yellow line is an example of a column grid line.\nGrid Track\nThe space between two adjacent grid lines. You can think of them as the columns or rows of the grid. Here\u2019s the grid track between the second and third-row grid lines.\nGrid Area\nThe total space surrounded by four grid lines. A grid area may be composed of any number of grid cells. Here\u2019s the grid area between row grid lines 1 and 3, and column grid lines 1 and 3.\nGrid Cell\nThe space between two adjacent row and two adjacent column grid lines. It\u2019s a single \u201cunit\u201d of the grid. Here\u2019s the grid cell between row grid lines 1 and 2, and column grid lines 2 and 3.\nCSS Grid Properties\nParent Container Properties\ndisplay\nDefines the element as a grid container and establishes a new grid formatting context for its contents.\nValues:\ngrid\n:\nGenerates a block-level grid\ninline-grid\n:\nGenerates an inline-level grid\n.container {\n  display: grid | inline-grid;\n}\nThe ability to pass grid parameters down through nested elements (aka subgrids) has been moved to\nCSS Grid Specification Level 2.\nHere\u2019s\na quick explanation\n.\ngrid-template-*\nDefines the columns and rows of the grid with a space-separated list of values. The values represent the track size, and the space between them represents the grid line.\nValues:\n<track-size>\n:\nCan be a length, a percentage, or a fraction of the free space in the grid using the\nfr\nunit.\n<line-name>\n:\nAn arbitrary name of your choosing.\n.container {\n  grid-template-columns: ...  ...;\n  /* e.g. \n      1fr 1fr\n      minmax(10px, 1fr) 3fr\n      repeat(5, 1fr)\n      50px auto 100px 1fr\n  */\n  grid-template-rows: ... ...;\n  /* e.g. \n      min-content 1fr min-content\n      100px 1fr max-content\n  */\n}\nGrid lines are automatically assigned positive numbers from these assignments (\n-1\nbeing an alternate for the very last row).\nBut you can choose to explicitly name the lines. Note the bracket syntax for the line names:\n.container {\n  grid-template-columns: [first] 40px [line2] 50px [line3] auto [col4-start] 50px [five] 40px [end];\n  grid-template-rows: [row1-start] 25% [row1-end] 100px [third-line] auto [last-line];\n}\nNote that a line can have more than one name. For example, here the second line will have two names:\nrow1-end\nand\nrow2-start\n:\n.container {\n  grid-template-rows: [row1-start] 25% [row1-end row2-start] 25% [row2-end];\n}\nIf your definition contains repeating parts, you can use the\nrepeat()\nnotation\nto streamline things:\n.container {\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 20px [col-start]);\n}\nWhich is equivalent to this:\n.container {\n  grid-template-columns: 20px [col-start] 20px [col-start] 20px [col-start];\n}\nIf multiple lines share the same name, they can be referenced by their line name and count.\n.item {\n  grid-column-start: col-start 2;\n}\nThe\nfr\nunit allows you to set the size of a track as a fraction of the free space of the grid container. For example, this will set each item to one third the width of the grid container:\n.container {\n  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;\n}\nThe free space is calculated\nafter\nany non-flexible items. In this example the total amount of free space available to the\nfr\nunits doesn\u2019t include the 50px:\n.container {\n  grid-template-columns: 1fr 50px 1fr 1fr;\n}\nContinue Reading\ngrid-template\nA shorthand for setting\ngrid-template-rows\n,\ngrid-template-columns\n, and\ngrid-template-areas\nin a single declaration.\nValues:\nnone\n:\nSets all three properties to their initial values.\n<grid-template-rows>\n/\n<grid-template-columns\n>:\nSets\ngrid-template-columns\nand\ngrid-template-rows\nto the specified values, respectively, and sets\ngrid-template-areas\nto\nnone\n.container {\n  grid-template: none | <grid-template-rows> / <grid-template-columns>;\n}\nIt also accepts a more complex but quite handy syntax for specifying all three. Here\u2019s an example:\n.container {\n  grid-template:\n    [row1-start] \"header header header\" 25px [row1-end]\n    [row2-start] \"footer footer footer\" 25px [row2-end]\n    / auto 50px auto;\n}\nThat\u2019s equivalent to this:\n.container {\n  grid-template-rows: [row1-start] 25px [row1-end row2-start] 25px [row2-end];\n  grid-template-columns: auto 50px auto;\n  grid-template-areas: \n    \"header header header\" \n    \"footer footer footer\";\n}\nSince\ngrid-template\ndoesn\u2019t reset the\nimplicit\ngrid properties (\ngrid-auto-columns\n,\ngrid-auto-rows\n, and\ngrid-auto-flow\n), which is probably what you want to do in most cases, it\u2019s recommended to use the\ngrid\nproperty instead of\ngrid-template\n.\nContinue Reading\ngrid-template-areas\nDefines a grid template by referencing the names of the grid areas which are specified with the\ngrid-area\nproperty. Repeating the name of a grid area causes the content to span those cells. A period signifies an empty cell. The syntax itself provides a visualization of the structure of the grid.\nValues:\n<grid-area-name>\n:\nThe name of a grid area specified with\ngrid-area\n.\n.\n:\nA period signifies an empty grid cell.\nnone\n:\nNo grid areas are defined.\n.container {\n  grid-template-areas: \n    \"<grid-area-name> | . | none | ...\"\n    \"...\";\n}\nExample:\n.item-a {\n  grid-area: header;\n}\n.item-b {\n  grid-area: main;\n}\n.item-c {\n  grid-area: sidebar;\n}\n.item-d {\n  grid-area: footer;\n}\n\n.container {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: 50px 50px 50px 50px;\n  grid-template-rows: auto;\n  grid-template-areas: \n    \"header header header header\"\n    \"main main . sidebar\"\n    \"footer footer footer footer\";\n}\nThat\u2019ll create a grid that\u2019s four columns wide by three rows tall. The entire top row will be composed of the\nheader\narea. The middle row will be composed of two\nmain\nareas, one empty cell, and one\nsidebar\narea. The last row is all\nfooter\n.\nEach row in your declaration needs to have the same number of cells.\nYou can use any number of adjacent periods to declare a single empty cell. As long as the periods have no spaces between them they represent a single cell.\nNotice that you\u2019re not naming lines with this syntax, just areas. When you use this syntax the lines on either end of the areas are actually getting named automatically. If the name of your grid area is\nfoo\n, the name of the area\u2019s starting row line and starting column line will be\nfoo\n-start\n, and the name of its last row line and last column line will be\nfoo\n-end\n. This means that some lines might have multiple names, such as the far left line in the above example, which will have three names:\nheader-start\n,\nmain-start\n, and\nfooter-start\n.\nContinue Reading\ngrid\nA shorthand for setting all of the following properties in a single declaration:\ngrid-template-rows\n,\ngrid-template-columns\n,\ngrid-template-areas\n,\ngrid-auto-rows\n,\ngrid-auto-columns\n, and\ngrid-auto-flow\nYou can only specify the explicit or the implicit grid properties in a single grid declaration.\nValues:\nnone\n:\nSets all sub-properties to their initial values.\n<grid-template>\n:\nWorks the same as the\ngrid-template\nshorthand.\n<grid-template-rows> / [ auto-flow && dense? ] <grid-auto-columns>?\n:\nSets\ngrid-template-rows\nto the specified value. If the\nauto-flow\nkeyword is to the right of the slash, it sets\ngrid-auto-flow\nto\ncolumn\n. If the\ndense\nkeyword is specified additionally, the auto-placement algorithm uses a \u201cdense\u201d packing algorithm. If\ngrid-auto-columns\nis omitted, it is set to\nauto\n.\n[ auto-flow && dense? ] <grid-auto-rows>? / <grid-template-columns>\n:\nSets\ngrid-template-columns\nto the specified value. If the\nauto-flow\nkeyword is to the left of the slash, it sets\ngrid-auto-flow\nto\nrow\n. If the\ndense\nkeyword is specified additionally, the auto-placement algorithm uses a \u201cdense\u201d packing algorithm. If\ngrid-auto-rows\nis omitted, it is set to\nauto\n.\nExamples:\nThe following two code blocks are equivalent:\n.container {\n  grid: 100px 300px / 3fr 1fr;\n}\n\n.container {\n  grid-template-rows: 100px 300px;\n  grid-template-columns: 3fr 1fr;\n}\nThe following two code blocks are equivalent:\n.container {\n  grid: auto-flow / 200px 1fr;\n}\n\n.container {\n  grid-auto-flow: row;\n  grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr;\n}\nThe following two code blocks are equivalent:\n.container {\n  grid: auto-flow dense 100px / 1fr 2fr;\n}\n\n.container {\n  grid-auto-flow: row dense;\n  grid-auto-rows: 100px;\n  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;\n}\nAnd the following two code blocks are equivalent:\n.container {\n  grid: 100px 300px / auto-flow 200px;\n}\n\n.container {\n  grid-template-rows: 100px 300px;\n  grid-auto-flow: column;\n  grid-auto-columns: 200px;\n}\nIt also accepts a more complex but quite handy syntax for setting everything at once. You specify\ngrid-template-areas\n,\ngrid-template-rows\nand\ngrid-template-columns\n, and all the other sub-properties are set to their initial values. What you\u2019re doing is specifying the line names and track sizes inline with their respective grid areas. This is easiest to describe with an example:\n.container {\n  grid: [row1-start] \"header header header\" 1fr [row1-end]\n        [row2-start] \"footer footer footer\" 25px [row2-end]\n        / auto 50px auto;\n}\nThat\u2019s equivalent to this:\n.container {\n  grid-template-areas: \n    \"header header header\"\n    \"footer footer footer\";\n  grid-template-rows: [row1-start] 1fr [row1-end row2-start] 25px [row2-end];\n  grid-template-columns: auto 50px auto;    \n}\nContinue Reading\njustify-items\nAligns grid items along the\ninline (row)\naxis (as opposed to\nalign-items\nwhich aligns along the\nblock (column)\naxis). This value applies to all grid items inside the container.\nValues:\nstretch\n(default):\nFills the whole width of the cell.\nstart\n:\nAligns items to be flush with the start edge of their cell\nend\n:\nAligns items to be flush with the end edge of their cell\ncenter\n:\nAligns items in the center of their cell\n.container {\n  justify-items: start | end | center | stretch;\n}\nExamples:\n.container {\n  justify-items: start;\n}\n.container {\n  justify-items: end;\n}\n.container {\n  justify-items: center;\n}\n.container {\n  justify-items: stretch;\n}\nThis behavior can also be set on individual grid items via the\njustify-self\nproperty.\nContinue Reading\nalign-items\nAligns grid items along the\nblock (column)\naxis (as opposed to\njustify-items\nwhich aligns along the\ninline (row)\naxis). This value applies to all grid items inside the container.\nValues:\nstretch\n(default):\nFills the whole height of the cell (this is the default)\nstart\n:\nAligns items to be flush with the start edge of their cell\nend\n:\nAligns items to be flush with the end edge of their cell\ncenter\n:\nAligns items in the center of their cell\nbaseline\n:\nAlign items\nalong text baseline\n. There are modifiers to\nbaseline\n\u2014\nfirst baseline\nand\nlast baseline\nwhich will use the baseline from the first or last line in the case of multi-line text.\n.container {\n  align-items: start | end | center | stretch;\n}\nExamples:\n.container {\n  align-items: start;\n}\n.container {\n  align-items: end;\n}\n.container {\n  align-items: center;\n}\n.container {\n  align-items: stretch;\n}\nThis behavior can also be set on individual grid items via the\nalign-self\nproperty.\nThere are also modifier keywords\nsafe\nand\nunsafe\n(usage is like\nalign-items: safe end\n). The\nsafe\nkeyword means \u201ctry to align like this, but not if it means aligning an item such that it moves into inaccessible overflow area\u201d, while\nunsafe\nwill allow moving content into inaccessible areas (\u201cdata loss\u201d).\nContinue Reading\nplace-items\nplace-items\nsets both the\nalign-items\nand\njustify-items\nproperties in a single declaration.\nValues:\n<align-items>\n/\n<justify-items>\n:\nThe first value sets\nalign-items\n, the second value\njustify-items\n. If the second value is omitted, the first value is assigned to both properties.\nThis can be very useful for super quick multi-directional centering:\n.center {\n  display: grid;\n  place-items: center;\n}\nContinue Reading\njustify-content\nSometimes the total size of your grid might be less than the size of its grid container. This could happen if all of your grid items are sized with non-flexible units like\npx\n. In this case you can set the alignment of the grid within the grid container. This property aligns the grid along the\ninline (row)\naxis (as opposed to\nalign-content\nwhich aligns the grid along the\nblock (column)\naxis).\nValues:\nstart\n:\nAligns the grid to be flush with the start edge of the grid container.\nend\n:\nAligns the grid to be flush with the end edge of the grid container.\ncenter\n:\nAligns the grid in the center of the grid container.\nstretch\n:\nResizes the grid items to allow the grid to fill the full width of the grid container.\nspace-around\n:\nPlaces an even amount of space between each grid item, with half-sized spaces on the far ends.\nspace-between\n:\nPlaces an even amount of space between each grid item, with no space at the far ends.\nspace-evenly\n:\nPlaces an even amount of space between each grid item, including the far ends.\n.container {\n  justify-content: start | end | center | stretch | space-around | space-between | space-evenly;    \n}\nExamples:\n.container {\n  justify-content: start;\n}\n.container {\n  justify-content: end;    \n}\n.container {\n  justify-content: center;    \n}\n.container {\n  justify-content: stretch;    \n}\n.container {\n  justify-content: space-around;    \n}\n.container {\n  justify-content: space-between;    \n}\n.container {\n  justify-content: space-evenly;    \n}\nContinue Reading\nalign-content\nSometimes the total size of your grid might be less than the size of its grid container. This could happen if all of your grid items are sized with non-flexible units like\npx\n. In this case you can set the alignment of the grid within the grid container. This property aligns the grid along the\nblock (column)\naxis (as opposed to\njustify-content\nwhich aligns the grid along the\ninline (row)\naxis).\nValues:\nstart\n:\nAligns the grid to be flush with the start edge of the grid container.\nend\n:\nAligns the grid to be flush with the end edge of the grid container.\ncenter\n:\nAligns the grid in the center of the grid container.\nstretch\n:\nResizes the grid items to allow the grid to fill the full height of the grid container.\nspace-around\n:\nPlaces an even amount of space between each grid item, with half-sized spaces on the far ends.\nspace-between\n:\nPlaces an even amount of space between each grid item, with no space at the far ends.\nspace-evenly\n:\nPlaces an even amount of space between each grid item, including the far ends.\n.container {\n  align-content: start | end | center | stretch | space-around | space-between | space-evenly;    \n}\nExamples:\n.container {\n  align-content: start;    \n}\n.container {\n  align-content: end;    \n}\n.container {\n  align-content: center;    \n}\n.container {\n  align-content: stretch;    \n}\n.container {\n  align-content: space-around;    \n}\n.container {\n  align-content: space-between;    \n}\n.container {\n  align-content: space-evenly;    \n}\nContinue Reading\nplace-content\nplace-content\nsets both the\nalign-content\nand\njustify-content\nproperties in a single declaration.\nValues:\n<align-content>\n/\n<justify-content>\n:\nThe first value sets\nalign-content\n, the second value\njustify-content\n. If the second value is omitted, the first value is assigned to both properties.\nContinue Reading\ngrid-auto-*\nSpecifies the size of any auto-generated grid tracks (aka\nimplicit grid tracks\n). Implicit tracks get created when there are more grid items than cells in the grid or when a grid item is placed outside of the explicit grid. (See\nThe Difference Between Explicit and Implicit Grids\n.)\nValues:\n<track-size>\n:\nCan be a length, a percentage, or a fraction of the free space in the grid (using the\nfr\nunit).\n.container {\n  grid-auto-columns: <track-size> ...;\n  grid-auto-rows: <track-size> ...;\n}\nTo illustrate how implicit grid tracks get created, think about this:\n.container {\n  grid-template-columns: 60px 60px;\n  grid-template-rows: 90px 90px;\n}\nThis creates a 2\u00d72 grid.\nBut now imagine you use\ngrid-column\nand\ngrid-row\nto position your grid items like this:\n.item-a {\n  grid-column: 1 / 2;\n  grid-row: 2 / 3;\n}\n.item-b {\n  grid-column: 5 / 6;\n  grid-row: 2 / 3;\n}\nWe told\n.item-b\nto start on column line 5 and end at column line 6,\nbut we never defined a column line 5 or 6\n. Because we referenced lines that don\u2019t exist, implicit tracks with widths of 0 are created to fill in the gaps. We can use\ngrid-auto-columns\nand\ngrid-auto-rows\nto specify the widths of these implicit tracks:\n.container {\n  grid-auto-columns: 60px;\n}\nContinue Reading\ngrid-auto-flow\nIf you have grid items that you don\u2019t explicitly place on the grid, the\nauto-placement algorithm\nkicks in to automatically place the items. This property controls how the auto-placement algorithm works.\nValues:\nrow\n:\nTells the auto-placement algorithm to fill in each row in turn, adding new rows as necessary (default)\ncolumn:\nTells the auto-placement algorithm to fill in each column in turn, adding new columns as necessary\ndense\n:\nTells the auto-placement algorithm to attempt to fill in holes earlier in the grid if smaller items come up later\n.container {\n  grid-auto-flow: row | column | row dense | column dense;\n}\nNote that\ndense\nonly changes the visual order of your items and might cause them to appear out of order, which is bad for accessibility.\nExamples:\n<section class=\"container\">\n  <div class=\"item-a\">item-a</div>\n  <div class=\"item-b\">item-b</div>\n  <div class=\"item-c\">item-c</div>\n  <div class=\"item-d\">item-d</div>\n  <div class=\"item-e\">item-e</div>\n</section>\nYou define a grid with five columns and two rows, and set\ngrid-auto-flow\nto\nrow\n(which is also the default):\n.container {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: 60px 60px 60px 60px 60px;\n  grid-template-rows: 30px 30px;\n  grid-auto-flow: row;\n}\nWhen placing the items on the grid, you only specify spots for two of them:\n.item-a {\n  grid-column: 1;\n  grid-row: 1 / 3;\n}\n\n.item-e {\n  grid-column: 5;\n  grid-row: 1 / 3;\n}\nBecause we set\ngrid-auto-flow\nto\nrow\n, our grid will look like this. Notice how the three items we didn\u2019t place (\nitem-b\n,\nitem-c\nand\nitem-d\n) flow across the available rows:\nIf we instead set\ngrid-auto-flow\nto\ncolumn\n,\nitem-b\n,\nitem-c\nand\nitem-d\nflow down the columns:\n.container {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: 60px 60px 60px 60px 60px;\n  grid-template-rows: 30px 30px;\n  grid-auto-flow: column;\n}\nContinue Reading\ngap\nThe\ngap\nproperty\nexplicitly controls the space between flex items. It applies that spacing\nonly between items\nnot on the outer edges. It is a shorthand that combines the\nrow-gap\nand\ncolumn-gap\nproperties.\n.container {\n  display: flex;\n  /* ... */\n  gap: 10px;\n  gap: 10px 20px; /* row-gap column gap */\n  row-gap: 10px;\n  column-gap: 20px;\n}\nThe behavior could be thought of as a\nminimum\ngutter, as if the gutter is bigger somehow (because of something like\njustify-content: space-between;\n) then the gap will only take effect if that space would end up smaller.\nIt is not exclusively for CSS Grid,\ngap\nworks in\nFlexbox\nand multi-column layout as well.\nContinue Reading\nChild Item Properties\ngrid-column-*\ngrid-row-*\nDetermines a grid item\u2019s location within the grid by referring to specific grid lines.\ngrid-column-start\n/\ngrid-row-start\nis the line where the item begins, and\ngrid-column-end\n/\ngrid-row-end\nis the line where the item ends.\nValues:\n<line>\n:\nCan be a number to refer to a numbered grid line, or a name to refer to a named grid line.\nspan <number>\n:\nThe item will span across the provided number of grid tracks.\nspan <name>\n:\nThe item will span across until it hits the next line with the provided name.\nauto\n:\nIndicates auto-placement, an automatic span, or a default span of one.\n.item {\n  grid-column-start: <number> | <name> | span <number> | span <name> | auto;\n  grid-column-end: <number> | <name> | span <number> | span <name> | auto;\n  grid-row-start: <number> | <name> | span <number> | span <name> | auto;\n  grid-row-end: <number> | <name> | span <number> | span <name> | auto;\n}\nExamples:\n.item-a {\n  grid-column-start: 2;\n  grid-column-end: five;\n  grid-row-start: row1-start;\n  grid-row-end: 3;\n}\n.item-b {\n  grid-column-start: 1;\n  grid-column-end: span col4-start;\n  grid-row-start: 2;\n  grid-row-end: span 2;\n}\nIf no\ngrid-column-end\n/\ngrid-row-end\nis declared, the item will span 1 track by default.\nItems can overlap each other.

They essentially mean \u201cportion of the remaining space\u201d. So a declaration like:\ngrid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr;\nMeans, loosely,\n25% 75%\n. Except that those percentage values are much more firm than fractional units are. For example, if you added padding to those percentage-based columns, now you\u2019ve broken 100% width (assuming a\ncontent-box\nbox model). Fractional units also much more friendly in combination with other units, as you can imagine:\ngrid-template-columns: 50px min-content 1fr;\nKeyword Values\nWhen sizing rows and columns, you can use all the\nlengths\nyou are used to, like\npx\n, rem, %, etc, but you also have keywords:\nmin-content\n:\nThe minimum size of the content. Imagine a line of text like \u201cE pluribus unum\u201d, the min-content is likely the width of the word \u201cpluribus.\u201d\nmax-content\n:\nThe maximum size of the content. Imagine the sentence above, the\nmax-content\nis the length of the whole sentence.\nauto\n:\nThis keyword is a lot like\nfr\nunits, except that they \u201close\u201d the fight in sizing against\nfr\nunits when allocating the remaining space.\nSizing Functions\nfit-content()\n:\nUses the space available, but never less than\nmin-content\nand never more than\nmax-content\n.\nmax()\n:\nThe CSS\nmax()\nfunction takes two or more comma-separated arguments of spacing values, evaluates them, and returns the largest value of the bunch.\nmin()\n:\nThe CSS\nmin()\nfunction takes two or more comma-separated arguments of spacing values, evaluates them,\u00a0and returns the smallest value\u00a0of the bunch.\nminmax()\n:\nThe CSS\nminmax()\nfunction is used exclusively with CSS Grid to define a size range for grid tracks (i.e., the grid\u2019s rows and columns). It lets you specify two arguments \u2014 a minimum size and a maximum size for a track \u2014 allowing the grid track to grow and shrink within that range, depending on the available space.\nThe\nrepeat()\nFunction\nThe\nrepeat()\nfunction can save some typing:\ngrid-template-columns:\n  1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;\n\n/* easier: */\ngrid-template-columns:\n  repeat(8, 1fr);\n\n/* especially when: */\ngrid-template-columns:\n  repeat(8, minmax(10px, 1fr));\nBut\nrepeat()\ncan get extra fancy when combined with keywords:\nauto-fill\n:\nFit as many possible columns as possible on a row, even if they are empty.\nauto-fit:\nFit whatever columns there are into the space. Prefer expanding columns to fill space rather than empty columns.\nThis bears the most famous snippet in all of CSS Grid and one of the\nall-time great CSS tricks\n:\ngrid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));\nThe difference between the keywords is\nspelled out in detail here\n.\nSubgrid\nSubgrid is an extremely useful feature of grids that allows grid items to have a grid of their own that inherits grid lines from the parent grid.\n.parent-grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(9, 1fr);\n}\n.grid-item {\n  grid-column: 2 / 7;\n\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: subgrid;\n}\n.child-of-grid-item {\n  /* gets to participate on parent grid! */\n  grid-column: 3 / 6;\n}\nIt\u2019s also useful to know about\ndisplay: contents;\n.

  "content_markdown": "Our comprehensive guide to CSS grid, focusing on all the settings both for the grid parent container and the grid child elements.\n\nReference this guide a lot? [Here\u2019s a high-resolution image you can print!](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/css-grid-poster.png)\n\n---\n\n### Introduction\n\nCSS Grid Layout (aka \u201cGrid\u201d or \u201cCSS Grid\u201d), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that, compared to any web layout system of the past, completely changes the way we design user interfaces. CSS has always been used to layout our web pages, but it\u2019s never done a very good job of it. First, we used tables, then floats, positioning and inline-block, but all of these methods were essentially hacks and left out a lot of important functionality (vertical centering, for instance).\n\n[CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) is also a very great layout tool, but its one-directional flow has [different use cases](https://css-tricks.com/quick-whats-the-difference-between-flexbox-and-grid/) \u2014 and they actually [work together](https://css-tricks.com/css-grid-replace-flexbox/) quite well! CSS Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we\u2019ve all been hacking our way around for as long as we\u2019ve been making websites.\n\nThe intention of this guide is to present CSS Grid concepts as they exist in the latest version of the specification. So, we will not cover [the out-of-date Internet Explorer syntax](https://css-tricks.com/css-grid-in-ie-debunking-common-ie-grid-misconceptions/) or other historical hacks.\n\n---\n\n### Key Terms\n\nBefore diving into the concepts of CSS Grid, it\u2019s important to understand the terminology. Since the terms involved here are all kinda conceptually similar, it\u2019s easy to confuse them with one another if you don\u2019t first memorize their meanings defined by the CSS Grid specification. But don\u2019t worry, there aren\u2019t many of them.\n\nGrid Container\n\nThe element on which\u00a0`display: grid`\u00a0is applied. It\u2019s the direct parent of all the grid items. In this example\u00a0`container`\u00a0is the grid container.\n\n```\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <div class=\"item item-1\"> </div>\n  <div class=\"item item-2\"> </div>\n  <div class=\"item item-3\"> </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nGrid Item\n\nThe children (i.e.\u00a0*direct*\u00a0descendants) of the grid container. Here the\u00a0`item`\u00a0elements are grid items, but\u00a0`sub-item`\u00a0isn\u2019t.\n\n```\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <div class=\"item\"> </div>\n  <div class=\"item\">\n    <p class=\"sub-item\"> </p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"item\"> </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nGrid Line\n\nThe dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be either vertical (\u201ccolumn grid lines\u201d) or horizontal (\u201crow grid lines\u201d) and reside on either side of a row or column. Here the yellow line is an example of a column grid line.\n\n![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/terms-grid-line.svg)\nGrid Track\n\nThe space between two adjacent grid lines. You can think of them as the columns or rows of the grid. Here\u2019s the grid track between the second and third-row grid lines.\n\n![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/terms-grid-track.svg)\nGrid Area\n\nThe total space surrounded by four grid lines. A grid area may be composed of any number of grid cells. Here\u2019s the grid area between row grid lines 1 and 3, and column grid lines 1 and 3.\n\n![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/terms-grid-area.svg)\nGrid Cell\n\nThe space between two adjacent row and two adjacent column grid lines. It\u2019s a single \u201cunit\u201d of the grid. Here\u2019s the grid cell between row grid lines 1 and 2, and column grid lines 2 and 3.\n\n![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/terms-grid-cell.svg)\n\n---\n\n### CSS Grid Properties\n\n![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/01-container.svg)\n\n#### Parent Container Properties\n\n`display`\n\nDefines the element as a grid container and establishes a new grid formatting context for its contents.\n\nValues:\n\n- **`grid`:** Generates a block-level grid\n- **`inline-grid`:** Generates an inline-level grid\n\n```\n.container {\n  display: grid | inline-grid;\n}\n```\n\nThe ability to pass grid parameters down through nested elements (aka subgrids) has been moved to [CSS Grid Specification Level 2.](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-2/#subgrids)\u00a0Here\u2019s\u00a0[a quick explanation](https://css-tricks.com/grid-level-2-and-subgrid/).\n\n`grid-template-*`\n\nDefines the columns and rows of the grid with a space-separated list of values. The values represent the track size, and the space between them represents the grid line.\n\nValues:\n\n- **`<track-size>`:** Can be a length, a percentage, or a fraction of the free space in the grid using the\u00a0`fr`\u00a0unit.\n- **`<line-name>`:** An arbitrary name of your choosing.\n\n```\n.container {\n  grid-template-columns: ...  ...;\n  /* e.g. \n      1fr 1fr\n      minmax(10px, 1fr) 3fr\n      repeat(5, 1fr)\n      50px auto 100px 1fr\n  */\n  grid-template-rows: ... ...;\n  /* e.g. \n      min-content 1fr min-content\n      100px 1fr max-content\n  */\n}\n```\n\nGrid lines are automatically assigned positive numbers from these assignments (`-1` being an alternate for the very last row).\n\n![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/template-columns-rows-01.svg)\n\nBut you can choose to explicitly name the lines. Note the bracket syntax for the line names:\n\n```\n.container {\n  grid-template-columns: [first] 40px [line2] 50px [line3] auto [col4-start] 50px [five] 40px [end];\n  grid-template-rows: [row1-start] 25% [row1-end] 100px [third-line] auto [last-line];\n}\n```\n\n![Grid with user named lines](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/template-column-rows-02.svg)\n\nNote that a line can have more than one name. For example, here the second line will have two names: `row1-end` and `row2-start`:\n\n```\n.container {\n  grid-template-rows: [row1-start] 25% [row1-end row2-start] 25% [row2-end];\n}\n```\n\nIf your definition contains repeating parts, you can use the\u00a0[`repeat()`\u00a0notation](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-css-grid-layout-repeat-notation?utm_medium=content_acq&utm_source=css-tricks&utm_campaign=&utm_content=awareness_bestsellers) to streamline things:\n\n```\n.container {\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 20px [col-start]);\n}\n```\n\nWhich is equivalent to this:\n\n```\n.container {\n  grid-template-columns: 20px [col-start] 20px [col-start] 20px [col-start];\n}\n```\n\nIf multiple lines share the same name, they can be referenced by their line name and count.\n\n```\n.item {\n  grid-column-start: col-start 2;\n}\n```\n\nThe\u00a0`fr`\u00a0unit allows you to set the size of a track as a fraction of the free space of the grid container. For example, this will set each item to one third the width of the grid container:\n\n```\n.container {\n  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;\n}\n```\n\nThe free space is calculated\u00a0*after*\u00a0any non-flexible items. In this example the total amount of free space available to the\u00a0`fr`\u00a0units doesn\u2019t include the 50px:\n\n```\n.container {\n  grid-template-columns: 1fr 50px 1fr 1fr;\n}\n```\n\n[Continue Reading](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/g/grid/grid-template-columns/)\n\n`grid-template`\n\nA shorthand for setting\u00a0`grid-template-rows`,\u00a0`grid-template-columns`, and\u00a0`grid-template-areas`\u00a0in a single declaration.\n\nValues:\n\n- **`none`:**\u00a0 Sets all three properties to their initial values.\n- **`<grid-template-rows>`\u00a0/\u00a0`<grid-template-columns`>:**\u00a0Sets\u00a0`grid-template-columns`\u00a0and\u00a0`grid-template-rows`\u00a0to the specified values, respectively, and sets\u00a0`grid-template-areas`\u00a0to\u00a0`none`\n\n```\n.container {\n  grid-template: none | <grid-template-rows> / <grid-template-columns>;\n}\n```\n\nIt also accepts a more complex but quite handy syntax for specifying all three. Here\u2019s an example:\n\n```\n.container {\n  grid-template:\n    [row1-start] \"header header header\" 25px [row1-end]\n    [row2-start] \"footer footer footer\" 25px [row2-end]\n    / auto 50px auto;\n}\n```\n\nThat\u2019s equivalent to this:\n\n```\n.container {\n  grid-template-rows: [row1-start] 25px [row1-end row2-start] 25px [row2-end];\n  grid-template-columns: auto 50px auto;\n  grid-template-areas: \n    \"header header header\" \n    \"footer footer footer\";\n}\n```\n\nSince\u00a0`grid-template`\u00a0doesn\u2019t reset the\u00a0*implicit*\u00a0grid properties (`grid-auto-columns`,\u00a0`grid-auto-rows`, and\u00a0`grid-auto-flow`), which is probably what you want to do in most cases, it\u2019s recommended to use the\u00a0`grid`\u00a0property instead of\u00a0`grid-template`.\n\n[Continue Reading](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/g/grid/grid-template/)\n\n`grid-template-areas`\n\nDefines a grid template by referencing the names of the grid areas which are specified with the\u00a0`grid-area`\u00a0property. Repeating the name of a grid area causes the content to span those cells. A period signifies an empty cell. The syntax itself provides a visualization of the structure of the grid.\n\nValues:\n\n- **`<grid-area-name>`:** The name of a grid area specified with\u00a0`grid-area`.\n- **`.`:**\u00a0A period signifies an empty grid cell.\n- **`none`:**\u00a0No grid areas are defined.\n\n```\n.container {\n  grid-template-areas: \n    \"<grid-area-name> | . | none | ...\"\n    \"...\";\n}\n```\n\nExample:\n\n```\n.item-a {\n  grid-area: header;\n}\n.item-b {\n  grid-area: main;\n}\n.item-c {\n  grid-area: sidebar;\n}\n.item-d {\n  grid-area: footer;\n}\n\n.container {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: 50px 50px 50px 50px;\n  grid-template-rows: auto;\n  grid-template-areas: \n    \"header header header header\"\n    \"main main . sidebar\"\n    \"footer footer footer footer\";\n}\n```\n\nThat\u2019ll create a grid that\u2019s four columns wide by three rows tall. The entire top row will be composed of the\u00a0**header**\u00a0area. The middle row will be composed of two\u00a0**main**\u00a0areas, one empty cell, and one\u00a0**sidebar**\u00a0area. The last row is all\u00a0**footer**.\n\n![Example of grid-template-areas](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dddgrid-template-areas.svg)\n\nEach row in your declaration needs to have the same number of cells.\n\nYou can use any number of adjacent periods to declare a single empty cell. As long as the periods have no spaces between them they represent a single cell.\n\nNotice that you\u2019re not naming lines with this syntax, just areas. When you use this syntax the lines on either end of the areas are actually getting named automatically. If the name of your grid area is\u00a0***foo***, the name of the area\u2019s starting row line and starting column line will be\u00a0***foo*-start**, and the name of its last row line and last column line will be\u00a0***foo*-end**. This means that some lines might have multiple names, such as the far left line in the above example, which will have three names: `header-start`, `main-start`, and `footer-start`.\n\n[Continue Reading](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/g/grid/grid-template-areas/)\n\n`grid`\n\nA shorthand for setting all of the following properties in a single declaration:\u00a0`grid-template-rows`,\u00a0`grid-template-columns`,\u00a0`grid-template-areas`,\u00a0`grid-auto-rows`,\u00a0`grid-auto-columns`, and\u00a0`grid-auto-flow`\n\nYou can only specify the explicit or the implicit grid properties in a single grid declaration.\n\nValues:\n\n- **`none`:** Sets all sub-properties to their initial values.\n- **`<grid-template>`:** Works the same as the\u00a0`grid-template`\u00a0shorthand.\n- **`<grid-template-rows> / [ auto-flow && dense? ] <grid-auto-columns>?`:** Sets\u00a0`grid-template-rows`\u00a0to the specified value. If the\u00a0`auto-flow`\u00a0keyword is to the right of the slash, it sets\u00a0`grid-auto-flow`\u00a0to\u00a0`column`. If the\u00a0`dense`\u00a0keyword is specified additionally, the auto-placement algorithm uses a \u201cdense\u201d packing algorithm. If\u00a0`grid-auto-columns`\u00a0is omitted, it is set to\u00a0`auto`.\n- **`[ auto-flow && dense? ] <grid-auto-rows>? / <grid-template-columns>`:** Sets\u00a0`grid-template-columns`\u00a0to the specified value. If the\u00a0`auto-flow`\u00a0keyword is to the left of the slash, it sets\u00a0`grid-auto-flow`\u00a0to\u00a0`row`. If the\u00a0`dense`\u00a0keyword is specified additionally, the auto-placement algorithm uses a \u201cdense\u201d packing algorithm. If\u00a0`grid-auto-rows`\u00a0is omitted, it is set to\u00a0`auto`.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe following two code blocks are equivalent:\n\n```\n.container {\n  grid: 100px 300px / 3fr 1fr;\n}\n\n.container {\n  grid-template-rows: 100px 300px;\n  grid-template-columns: 3fr 1fr;\n}\n```\n\nThe following two code blocks are equivalent:\n\n```\n.container {\n  grid: auto-flow / 200px 1fr;\n}\n\n.container {\n  grid-auto-flow: row;\n  grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr;\n}\n```\n\nThe following two code blocks are equivalent:\n\n```\n.container {\n  grid: auto-flow dense 100px / 1fr 2fr;\n}\n\n.container {\n  grid-auto-flow: row dense;\n  grid-auto-rows: 100px;\n  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;\n}\n```\n\nAnd the following two code blocks are equivalent:\n\n```\n.container {\n  grid: 100px 300px / auto-flow 200px;\n}\n\n.container {\n  grid-template-rows: 100px 300px;\n  grid-auto-flow: column;\n  grid-auto-columns: 200px;\n}\n```\n\nIt also accepts a more complex but quite handy syntax for setting everything at once. You specify\u00a0`grid-template-areas`,\u00a0`grid-template-rows`\u00a0and\u00a0`grid-template-columns`, and all the other sub-properties are set to their initial values. What you\u2019re doing is specifying the line names and track sizes inline with their respective grid areas. This is easiest to describe with an example:\n\n```\n.container {\n  grid: [row1-start] \"header header header\" 1fr [row1-end]\n        [row2-start] \"footer footer footer\" 25px [row2-end]\n        / auto 50px auto;\n}\n```\n\nThat\u2019s equivalent to this:\n\n```\n.container {\n  grid-template-areas: \n    \"header header header\"\n    \"footer footer footer\";\n  grid-template-rows: [row1-start] 1fr [row1-end row2-start] 25px [row2-end];\n  grid-template-columns: auto 50px auto;    \n}\n```\n\n[Continue Reading](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/g/grid/)\n\n`justify-items`\n\nAligns grid items along the\u00a0*inline (row)*\u00a0axis (as opposed to\u00a0`align-items`\u00a0which aligns along the\u00a0*block (column)*\u00a0axis).

Implicit tracks get created when there are more grid items than cells in the grid or when a grid item is placed outside of the explicit grid. (See\u00a0[The Difference Between Explicit and Implicit Grids](https://css-tricks.com/difference-explicit-implicit-grids/).)\n\nValues:\n\n- **`<track-size>`:** Can be a length, a percentage, or a fraction of the free space in the grid (using the\u00a0`fr`\u00a0unit).\n\n```\n.container {\n  grid-auto-columns: <track-size> ...;\n  grid-auto-rows: <track-size> ...;\n}\n```\n\nTo illustrate how implicit grid tracks get created, think about this:\n\n```\n.container {\n  grid-template-columns: 60px 60px;\n  grid-template-rows: 90px 90px;\n}\n```\n\n![Example of 2x2 grid](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grid-auto-columns-rows-01.svg)\n\nThis creates a 2\u00d72 grid.\n\nBut now imagine you use\u00a0`grid-column`\u00a0and\u00a0`grid-row`\u00a0to position your grid items like this:\n\n```\n.item-a {\n  grid-column: 1 / 2;\n  grid-row: 2 / 3;\n}\n.item-b {\n  grid-column: 5 / 6;\n  grid-row: 2 / 3;\n}\n```\n\n![Example of implicit tracks](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grid-auto-columns-rows-02.svg)\n\nWe told `.item-b` to start on column line 5 and end at column line 6,\u00a0*but we never defined a column line 5 or 6*.

It is a shorthand that combines the `row-gap` and `column-gap` properties.\n\n```\n.container {\n  display: flex;\n  /* ... */\n  gap: 10px;\n  gap: 10px 20px; /* row-gap column gap */\n  row-gap: 10px;\n  column-gap: 20px;\n}\n```\n\nThe behavior could be thought of as a *minimum* gutter, as if the gutter is bigger somehow (because of something like `justify-content: space-between;`) then the gap will only take effect if that space would end up smaller.\n\nIt is not exclusively for CSS Grid, `gap` works in [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and multi-column layout as well.\n\n[Continue Reading](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/g/gap/)\n\n![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/02-items.svg)\n\n#### Child Item Properties\n\n`grid-column-*`  \n`grid-row-*`\n\nDetermines a grid item\u2019s location within the grid by referring to specific grid lines.\u00a0`grid-column-start`/`grid-row-start`\u00a0is the line where the item begins, and\u00a0`grid-column-end`/`grid-row-end`\u00a0is the line where the item ends.\n\nValues:\n\n- **`<line>`:** Can be a number to refer to a numbered grid line, or a name to refer to a named grid line.\n- **`span <number>`:** The item will span across the provided number of grid tracks.\n- **`span <name>`:** The item will span across until it hits the next line with the provided name.\n- **`auto`:** Indicates auto-placement, an automatic span, or a default span of one.\n\n```\n.item {\n  grid-column-start: <number> | <name> | span <number> | span <name> | auto;\n  grid-column-end: <number> | <name> | span <number> | span <name> | auto;\n  grid-row-start: <number> | <name> | span <number> | span <name> | auto;\n  grid-row-end: <number> | <name> | span <number> | span <name> | auto;\n}\n```\n\nExamples:\n\n```\n.item-a {\n  grid-column-start: 2;\n  grid-column-end: five;\n  grid-row-start: row1-start;\n  grid-row-end: 3;\n}\n```\n\n![Example of grid-row/column-start/end](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grid-column-row-start-end-01.svg)\n\n```\n.item-b {\n  grid-column-start: 1;\n  grid-column-end: span col4-start;\n  grid-row-start: 2;\n  grid-row-end: span 2;\n}\n```\n\n![Example of grid-row/column-start/end](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/grid-column-row-start-end-02.svg)\n\nIf no\u00a0`grid-column-end`/`grid-row-end`\u00a0is declared, the item will span 1 track by default.\n\nItems can overlap each other.

They essentially mean \u201cportion of the remaining space\u201d. So a declaration like:\n\n```\ngrid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr;\n```\n\nMeans, loosely, `25% 75%`. Except that those percentage values are much more firm than fractional units are. For example, if you added padding to those percentage-based columns, now you\u2019ve broken 100% width (assuming a `content-box` box model). Fractional units also much more friendly in combination with other units, as you can imagine:\n\n```\ngrid-template-columns: 50px min-content 1fr;\n```\n\nKeyword Values\n\nWhen sizing rows and columns, you can use all the\u00a0[lengths](https://css-tricks.com/the-lengths-of-css/)\u00a0you are used to, like\u00a0`px`, rem, %, etc, but you also have keywords:\n\n- **`min-content`:** The minimum size of the content. Imagine a line of text like \u201cE pluribus unum\u201d, the min-content is likely the width of the word \u201cpluribus.\u201d\n- **`max-content`:** The maximum size of the content. Imagine the sentence above, the `max-content` is the length of the whole sentence.\n- **`auto`:** This keyword is a lot like `fr` units, except that they \u201close\u201d the fight in sizing against `fr` units when allocating the remaining space.\nSizing Functions\n\n- **`fit-content()`:** Uses the space available, but never less than `min-content` and never more than `max-content`.\n- **`max()`:** The CSS\u00a0`max()`\u00a0function takes two or more comma-separated arguments of spacing values, evaluates them, and returns the largest value of the bunch.\n- **`min()`:** The CSS\u00a0`min()`\u00a0function takes two or more comma-separated arguments of spacing values, evaluates them,\u00a0and returns the smallest value\u00a0of the bunch.\n- **`minmax()`:** The CSS\u00a0`minmax()`\u00a0function is used exclusively with CSS Grid to define a size range for grid tracks (i.e., the grid\u2019s rows and columns). It lets you specify two arguments \u2014 a minimum size and a maximum size for a track \u2014 allowing the grid track to grow and shrink within that range, depending on the available space.\nThe `repeat()` Function\n\nThe\u00a0`repeat()`\u00a0function can save some typing:\n\n```\ngrid-template-columns:\n  1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;\n\n/* easier: */\ngrid-template-columns:\n  repeat(8, 1fr);\n\n/* especially when: */\ngrid-template-columns:\n  repeat(8, minmax(10px, 1fr));\n```\n\nBut `repeat()` can get extra fancy when combined with keywords:\n\n- **`auto-fill`:** Fit as many possible columns as possible on a row, even if they are empty.\n- `auto-fit:` Fit whatever columns there are into the space. Prefer expanding columns to fill space rather than empty columns.\n\nThis bears the most famous snippet in all of CSS Grid and one of the [all-time great CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/books/greatest-css-tricks/flexible-grids/):\n\n```\ngrid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));\n```\n\nThe difference between the keywords is [spelled out in detail here](https://css-tricks.com/auto-sizing-columns-css-grid-auto-fill-vs-auto-fit/).\n\n---\n\n### Subgrid\n\nSubgrid is an extremely useful feature of grids that allows grid items to have a grid of their own that inherits grid lines from the parent grid.\n\n```\n.parent-grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(9, 1fr);\n}\n.grid-item {\n  grid-column: 2 / 7;\n\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: subgrid;\n}\n.child-of-grid-item {\n  /* gets to participate on parent grid! */\n  grid-column: 3 / 6;\n}\n```\n\nIt\u2019s also useful to know about `display: contents;`. This is *not* the same as subgrid, but it can be a useful tool sometimes in a similar fashion.\n\n```\n<div class=\"grid-parent\">\n\n  <div class=\"grid-item\"></div>\n  <div class=\"grid-item\"></div>\n\n  <ul style=\"display: contents;\">\n    <!-- These grid-items get to participate on \n         the same grid!-->\n    <li class=\"grid-item\"></li>\n    <li class=\"grid-item\"></li>\n  </ul>\n\n</div>\n```\n\n[grid](https://css-tricks.com/tag/grid/)\n\n**Link**\non\nMay 8, 2018 \n\n### [Grid Level 2 and Subgrid](https://css-tricks.com/grid-level-2-and-subgrid/)\n\n[![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/cache/breeze-extra/gravatars/41a6f9778d12dfedcc7ec3727d64a12491d75d9a65d4b9323feb075391ae6795)](https://css-tricks.com/author/chriscoyier/) \n[Chris Coyier](https://css-tricks.com/author/chriscoyier/)\n\n[grid](https://css-tricks.com/tag/grid/) [subgrid](https://css-tricks.com/tag/subgrid/)\n\n**Link**\non\nJun 20, 2019 \n\n### [Hello Subgrid!](https://css-tricks.com/hello-subgrid/)\n\n[![](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/cache/breeze-extra/gravatars/me-black-white-80x80.jpg?resize=80%2C80&ssl=1)](https://css-tricks.com/author/robinrendle/) \n[Robin Rendle](https://css-tricks.com/author/robinrendle/)\n\n[flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/tag/flexbox/) [grid](https://css-tricks.com/tag/grid/) [subgrid](https://css-tricks.com/tag/subgrid/)\n\n**Article**\non\nSep 30, 2020 \n\n### [Achieving Vertical Alignment (Thanks, Subgrid!)](https://css-tricks.com/achieving-vertical-alignment-thanks-subgrid/)\n\n[![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/cache/breeze-extra/gravatars/13a6f6183bda8f2810a35a909289b0e26b201f0d5be7cb596b92d7f867f3ef1f)](https://css-tricks.com/author/cathydutton/) \n[Cathy Dutton](https://css-tricks.com/author/cathydutton/)\n\n---\n\n### CSS Grid & Masonry Layouts\n\nThink of masonry layouts like erecting a wall of stones or bricks:\n\n![A gray stone wall.](https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/masonry.jpg?resize=1024%2C711)\n\nThere are [lots of approaches to CSS masonry](https://css-tricks.com/piecing-together-approaches-for-a-css-masonry-layout/), but mostly of them are trickery and either have major downsides or aren\u2019t what you quite expect.\n\nThe CSS Working Group is in the process of defining an official approach for creating masonry layouts in the CSS Grid specification. This is an ongoing discussion at the time of this writing. In the meantime, you can read about [the competing proposals](https://css-tricks.com/css-masonry-css-grid/) debating whether to use a CSS Grid or Flexbox approach, get context on [the

today](https://css-tricks.com/making-a-masonry-layout-that-works-today/) using an alternative approach.\n\n---\n\n### Animating CSS Grid\n\nAccording to the CSS Grid Layout Module Level 1 specification, there are 5 animatable grid properties:\n\n- `gap`,\u00a0`row-gap`,\u00a0`column-gap`\u00a0as a length, percentage, or calculation.\n- `grid-template-columns`,\u00a0`grid-template-rows`\u00a0as a simple list of lengths, percentages, or calculations, provided the only differences are the values of the length, percentage, or calculated components in the list.\n\nAs of this writing, only the animation of\u00a0`gap`,\u00a0`row-gap`,\u00a0`column-gap`\u00a0is implemented in any of the tested browsers.\n\n| Browser |
