However, the accordion can be modified to have a\n[flush alignment](/components/accordion/usage#alignment) where the titles and\ncontent are instead flush aligned with the top and bottom borders having 0px\npadding.\n\n![accordion grid placement](/static/c2ebd73fe035bfdb41a1c57e42a4c4f3/3cbba/accordion-placement-1.png)\n\n## Content\n\n### Main elements\n\n#### Title\n\n- The title should be as brief as possible while still being clear and\n  descriptive.\n- Each title should be wrapped in a\n  [role heading](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#wai-aria-roles-states-and-properties)\n  (h1-h6) that is appropriate for the information architecture of the page.\n\n#### Body copy\n\n- Content inside of a section may be split into paragraphs and include\n  sub-headers if needed.\n\n### Scrolling content\n\nWhen the accordion content is longer than the viewport the whole accordion\nshould vertically scroll.

Consider the\ntype and length of content you are working with when choosing a content\ncontainer. Longer form content may benefit from tabs or a content switcher while\nvery short content might do better in a structured list.\n\n- [Content switchers](/components/content-switcher/usage) allow users to toggle\n  between two or more content sections within the same space on the screen.\n- [Progress indicators](/components/progress-indicator/usage) guide users\n  through any linear, multistep task by showing the user their completed,\n  current, and future steps.\n- [Structured lists](/components/structured-list/usage) group content that is\n  similar or related, such as terms and definitions.\n- [Tabs](/components/tabs/usage) organize related content by allowing the user\n  to navigate between groups of information that appear within the same context.\n- [Tree view](/components/tree-view/usage) is a hierarchical structure that\n  provides nested levels of navigation.\n\n## References\n\n- Hoa Loranger,\n  [Accordions Are Not Always the Answer for Complex Content on Desktops](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/accordions-complex-content/)\n  (Nielsen Norman Group, 2014)\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n\n[Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/edit/main/src/pages/components/accordion/usage.mdx)\n\n[Previous\n\nComponents: Overview](/components/overview/components/)\n\n[Next\n\nAccordion: Style](/components/accordion/style/)",
