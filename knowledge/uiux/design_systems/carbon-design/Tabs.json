Tabs can be used on full page layouts or in\ncomponents such as modals, cards, or side panels.\nWhen to use\nTo help reduce cognitive load, use tabs to group related information into\ndifferent categories. Tabs can be used to organize content such as forms,\nsettings, and dashboards so a user does not have to navigate away from their\nworkflow to complete their task.\nWhen not to use\nFiltering the same content\nWhen toggling between different formats of the same content or filtering the\nsame content, use\ncontent switcher\ninstead. Content switcher is often used alongside tabs, but it typically serves\nat a lower hierarchy to organize related content within the tab\u2019s contents.\nIndicating progress\nWhen the user needs to work through a step by step linear process, use a\nprogress indicator\n. Tabs help organize\ninformation hierarchically but remain flexible in how content can be designed\nand consumed.\nComparing information\nTabs should not be used if the user needs to compare information in different\ngroups, as this would result in the user having to click back and forth to\ncomplete a task.\nVariants\nVariant\nPurpose\nLine\nA standalone tab that can also be nested within components.

Tablist extended\nbackground\nAlignment\nTabs can have two kinds of width alignment:\nauto-width\nor\ngrid aware\nwidth. Contained tabs can use either of these alignments, but line tabs must\nalways use the auto-width alignment.\nAuto-width alignment\nAuto-width alignment is the default behavior for both line tabs and contained\ntabs. Each tab will be a different size depending on the label\u2019s character count\nbut will have consistent padding on each side of the label. The first label,\nselected by default, should align to the grid. Where the tabs end will vary and\nmay not end on the grid.\nExample of line tabs using auto-width alignment\nGrid aware width alignment\nInstead of using the default auto-width alignment behavior, contained tabs can\nhave grid aware alignment. The tabs span a set of columns as a group, with each\ntab equal in width. The first tab\u2019s label should align with the first column you\nare using, with the last tab in the group always ending at a column\u2019s edge. The\ntabs in between will flow accordingly and may or may not align with the grid,\nbut they will always be the same width size.\nUse the\n2x grid\nto drive visual rhythm by spacing content in multiples of two columns and\naligning the beginning and ending of the tab elements with content below the\ntabs when possible. Depending on breakpoints, vertical tabs align to grid\ncolumns spanning 4 or 2 columns of the 16-column grid and connect to a tab panel\nthat can be 8 or 12 columns wide. See\nvertical tabs\nfor more information on breakpoints and responsiveness.\nUse grid aware contained tabs when:\nWhen there are four tabs or less\nWhen the tablist can fit on the 2x grid easily without crowding labels\nLabels are short and concise\nWhen other elements on the page can align to the tablist\nExample of contained tabs using grid aware alignment\nAlignment with tab labels\nMuch like\nbuttons\n,\nalignment of tabs depends on where they appear and whether or not they\u2019re\ncontained within another component. As a general rule, the first label for both\nline tabs and contained tabs align with the grid and the text below. If tabs are\nwithin another component, such as a card, follow the grid that you are using\ninside the component and align the label with text in the component. Vertical\ntab labels also align with the grid, so all labels in a tablist will align on\nthe same grid column.\nDo align tab labels with the grid\nDo not align tab container with the grid\nAlignment within a component\nWhen using line tabs within a component (like a modal), the first label should\nalways align to the other content in the space. Do not use contained tabs. The\nedges of the line tab may also bleed to the edges of the space if needed\ndepending on the container\u2019s margins.\u00a0A trailing rule may be added from the end\nof the last tab to the edge of the content area to add hierarchical clarity and\nbalance the tabs with the other content.\nAligning tabs within a component\nContent\nMain elements\nLabels\nUse short tab labels that are clear and specific. Labels should be one to two\nwords, as these are easier to scan. Vertical tabs allow for more characters\nwithin a tab, but stay as concise as possible to avoid truncation and allow\nspace for labels in various languages.\nText labels should clearly communicate the view users will see and the content\ncontained in the view.\nSecondary labels\nContained tabs can have secondary labels to add clarity or assist the user in\nchoosing the right selection.\nOverflow content\nLine and tab labels do not need truncation since these types of tabs allow for\nhorizontal scrolling. The tabs themselves can grow and shrink accordingly.\nHowever, when a label is too long within a vertical tab, the label overflows to\ntwo lines and then truncates with an ellipsis. By mouse, the full title is\ndisclosed in a browser tooltip on hover. By keyboard, the full title is\ndisclosed on focus in a tooltip.\nOn hover, full title is disclosed in a browser tooltip (left) and on focus,\nfull title is disclosed in Carbon tooltip (right)\nFurther guidance\nFor further content guidance, see Carbon\u2019s\ncontent guidelines\n.\nUniversal behaviors\nStates\nTabs have two main states\u2014\nselected\nand\nunselected\n. Other interactive\nstates are\nhover, focus,\nand\ndisabled\n. The default view is one tab is\npreselected and is usually the first tab. Only one tab can be selected at a\ntime. When a user chooses a new item, the previous tab is automatically\ndeselected. If a user navigates away from a tab, it remains the selected tab\nuntil altered by the user.\nFor detailed visual information about the various states for this component, see\nthe\nStyle tab\n.\nState\nWhen to use\nSelected\nWhen a user clicks or uses the arrows keys to activate the tab.\nUnselected\nWhen the user navigates to another tab and the tab is inactive.\nHover\nWhen a user is hovering over the tab with the mouse cursor to interact with it.\nFocus\nWhen a user clicks on the tab or navigates using the keyboard with left and right arrows, it becomes focused, indicating the user has successfully navigated to the component.\nDisabled\nWhen a user is not allowed to interact with the tab due to either permissions, dependencies, or pre-requisites. The disabled state completely removes the interactive function from a component. The styling is not subject to WCAG contrast compliance.\nScrollable\nWhen your page requires more tabs that can fit or needs to adapt to a new\nbrowser size, line and contained tabs should become scrollable. Left and right\narrows appear to help navigate the user through tabs that might be off-page.\nExample of scrolling in line tabs (top) and contained tabs (bottom)\nInteractions\nMouse\nUsers can trigger a state change by clicking anywhere in the container area.\nKeyboard\nOne tab should be selected by default. Users can navigate between tabs by\npressing right or left arrow keys. For additional keyboard interactions, see the\nAccessibility tab\n.\nAutomatic and manual\nAutomatic and manual tablists differ in how the tab items are activated.\nFor automatic tablists, focus and selection are synchronized. When the user\narrows to a tab, it becomes selected, and the tab panel under the tab updates\nautomatically. Use automatic tabs when tab panel content can load quickly,\nallowing for users to scan quickly through information to make a decision\nwithout latency.\nManual tablists allow the user to arrow between the tab items without updating\nthe tab panel underneath. When the user navigates using arrows, the selected tab\nremains selected while focus moves to the next tab. In order to select the\nfocused tab (and update the tabpanel under the tab), the user would press\nEnter\nCopy to clipboard\nor\nSpace\nCopy to clipboard\n. Use manual tabs when information in the tab panel will take\na longer time to load. This will allow a keyboard user or screen reader to\nnavigate through the tablist without having to wait for content to load. Learn\nmore about automatic verses manual tablists in the\nKeyboard interactions\nsection of the accessibility tab.\nFor additional information, see the\nAccessibility tab\n.\nResponsive behavior\nIn responsive situations, horizontal tabs should not wrap to multiple lines or\nstack on top of each other; instead, they should scroll horizontally. Vertical\ntabs do not scroll horizontally because of their vertical persistent structure\nand always stack.\nBreakpoints\nWhen using tabs that have grid aware width alignment, they should follow these\nresponsive rules:\nMax, XLG, and LG breakpoints: Use eight grid aware tabs or less.\nMD and SM breakpoints: Grid aware tabs will automatically change to auto-width\nalignment to reduce extra space on smaller screens.\nLine tabs\nA line tab is standalone tab that can also be nested within components. Although\nit is commonly used within components, such as a modal or header, line tabs can\nalso be used for large content areas using the entire page for layout, not\nconnected to any other components. Line tabs are highly flexible and can be\nplaced on background or layer tokens, making it easy to use in many different\nscenarios. To help define the tab panel, which is the content area below the\nselected tab, a line can be used that extends from the tablist to the end of the\npanel. This is currently not part of the Carbon line tabs component and must be\nadded by teams if desired.\nContained tabs\nContained tabs are an emphasized tab commonly used for defined content areas\nlike sub-pages. Contained tabs are always attached to a tab panel (background\ncontainer) that uses the same layer token as the selected tab. Since the\ncontained tabs are on layers, the tab content tends to stand out against the\nbackground and maintain a high visual hierarchy while line tabs tend to blend\ninto content more easily. Because of the layering model, be mindful of the\nlayers used within the tabs so the content does not get too visually\ncomplicated, especially within smaller areas.\nVertical tabs\nVertical tabs are left and vertically-aligned tabs that allow a user to scan\nthrough information from top to bottom. This vertical orientation is good for\nquickly browsing and accessing information, such as a\nget started\npattern. Do not use vertical tabs in place of\nnavigation\n.\nThe tab panel should stay the same height as tabs switch so content outside the\ntabs stays in a consistent place. The vertical tablist and panel height should\nbe determined by the tab that has the most content. To avoid excessive scrolling\nwithin the tab panel, do not overload it with too much content. If more space is\nneeded than the tab panel allows, consider using line or contained tabs that\nallow for full page layouts. Both the tablist and the tab panels are always on\nthe same layer. At extra large and large breakpoints, vertical tablist spans 4\ncolumns of the 16-column grid. At the medium breakpoint, the vertical tablist\nspans 2 columns. At the small breakpoint, the vertical tablist uses scrolling\ncontained tabs.\nExample of Vertical tabs in a get started pattern\nModifiers\nTabs with icons\nYou may use icons in either line or contained tabs. Icons are always pinned to\nthe right of the tab and do not appear above, below, or to the left of the\nlabel.\nExample of contained tabs with icons.\nIcon-only tabs\nYou may use icon-only tabs with both line and contained tabs. Icons must be\neasily recognized and globally accepted. These work best in small, defined\nspaces and in components. Always use a tooltip for an icon description on hover\nand focus to add clarity.\nExample of icon-only tabs within a side panel.\nSecondary labels\nContained tabs that align with the grid allow for a secondary label. Do not use\nsecondary labels with line tabs, auto-width contained tabs, or vertical tabs.\nExample of contained tabs with a secondary label and icon.\nDismissible tabs\nDismissible tabs allow users to close tabs providing a focused and relevant\nexperience. Users can add or remove contained or line tabs as needed,\naccommodating future content additions or modifications without drastically\nchanging the overall layout or structure.\nExample of dismissible line tabs (top) and dismissible contained tabs (bottom)\nWhen to use\nUse dismissible tabs to offer flexibility and scalability in complex\ninterfaces that require users to create multiple sections or modules.\nUse dismissible tabs for content created or curated by the user.\nUse to focus a specific data set or search results.\nWhen not to use\nDo not use when tabs contain frequently used or critical information.\nDo not use as navigation.\nDismissible tabs with icons\nCarbon provides an option to include icons within the dismissible tabs. Only use\nicons within dismissible tabs if all tabs will include icons. Do not mix\ndismissible tabs without icons with dismissible tabs with icons.\nDismissing a tab\nWhen dismissing a tab, an inline warning or modal may be used when information\ncontained in a tab will no longer be accessible or difficult to retrieve. Since\nwarnings, especially modals, are highly disruptive, only use when the dismissal\ncauses errors, unintentional deletions, or unsaved changes.\nTriggering a new tab\nThere are various ways to trigger a new tab. The trigger button can visually\nchange its shape and size depending on the use case. Keep the trigger close\nenough to the new tab to associate the add action with the new tab item. The\norder of tabs can be ascending or descending depending on use case but do keep\nthem in a sequential, logical order.\nIf all tabs are dismissible, make sure a user understands how to trigger new\ntabs once the tabs are gone. Provide visual cues, such as a container or\nplaceholder tab, so the user clearly understands that the trigger button is\ncreating a new tab in a place they expect.\nExample of dismissible tabs within a UI utilizing a button to add a tab\nRelated\nContent switcher versus tabs\nContent switchers\nallow users to compare and toggle between alternate views of similar or related\ncontent. Content that is grouped into tabs is part of the same bigger context\nbut the content does not overlap.\nProgress indicator versus tabs\nProgress indicator\ncontent moves in a logical progression, showing next steps to guide the user\nthrough the completion of a task. Tabs organize content into groups that the\nuser can navigate through; they do not support progressive tasks.\nReferences\nJakob Nielson,\nTabs, Used Right\n(Nielsen\nNorman Group, 2016)\nFeedback\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\nGitHub\n.\nEdit this page on GitHub\nPrevious\nComponents: Structured list\nNext\nTabs: Style",

Contained tabs can use either of these alignments, but line tabs must\nalways use the auto-width alignment.\n\n#### Auto-width alignment\n\nAuto-width alignment is the default behavior for both line tabs and contained\ntabs. Each tab will be a different size depending on the label\u2019s character count\nbut will have consistent padding on each side of the label. The first label,\nselected by default, should align to the grid. Where the tabs end will vary and\nmay not end on the grid.\n\n![Example of line tabs using auto-width alignment](/static/8c99669267cbffded6aa0f76ab8454dd/3cbba/tab-usage-7.png)\n\nExample of line tabs using auto-width alignment\n\n#### Grid aware width alignment\n\nInstead of using the default auto-width alignment behavior, contained tabs can\nhave grid aware alignment. The tabs span a set of columns as a group, with each\ntab equal in width. The first tab\u2019s label should align with the first column you\nare using, with the last tab in the group always ending at a column\u2019s edge. The\ntabs in between will flow accordingly and may or may not align with the grid,\nbut they will always be the same width size.\n\nUse the\n[2x grid](https://carbondesignsystem.com/elements/2x-grid/overview/#2x-grid-fundamentals)\nto drive visual rhythm by spacing content in multiples of two columns and\naligning the beginning and ending of the tab elements with content below the\ntabs when possible. Depending on breakpoints, vertical tabs align to grid\ncolumns spanning 4 or 2 columns of the 16-column grid and connect to a tab panel\nthat can be 8 or 12 columns wide. See\n[vertical tabs](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/tabs/usage/#vertical-tabs)\nfor more information on breakpoints and responsiveness.\n\nUse grid aware contained tabs when:\n\n- When there are four tabs or less\n- When the tablist can fit on the 2x grid easily without crowding labels\n- Labels are short and concise\n- When other elements on the page can align to the tablist\n\n![Example of contained tabs using grid aware alignment](/static/e980d67d2b313b32e56038b0489a86c8/3cbba/tab-usage-8.png)\n\nExample of contained tabs using grid aware alignment\n\n#### Alignment with tab labels\n\nMuch like\n[buttons](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/#alignment),\nalignment of tabs depends on where they appear and whether or not they\u2019re\ncontained within another component. As a general rule, the first label for both\nline tabs and contained tabs align with the grid and the text below. If tabs are\nwithin another component, such as a card, follow the grid that you are using\ninside the component and align the label with text in the component. Vertical\ntab labels also align with the grid, so all labels in a tablist will align on\nthe same grid column.\n\n![Do align tab labels with the grid](/static/41048d9aab906071bc043037b3c9d60a/a5df1/tab-usage-6-do.png)\n\nDo align tab labels with the grid\n\n![Do not align tab container with the grid](/static/9ceac008c24e6919b089c7b81d69335a/a5df1/tab-usage-6-dont.png)\n\nDo not align tab container with the grid\n\n#### Alignment within a component\n\nWhen using line tabs within a component (like a modal), the first label should\nalways align to the other content in the space.

Left and right\narrows appear to help navigate the user through tabs that might be off-page.\n\n![Example of line and contained tabs that scroll](/static/f547a2ab428541020b64356c48f408b4/3cbba/tab-usage-11.png)\n\nExample of scrolling in line tabs (top) and contained tabs (bottom)\n\n### Interactions\n\n#### Mouse\n\nUsers can trigger a state change by clicking anywhere in the container area.\n\n#### Keyboard\n\nOne tab should be selected by default. Users can navigate between tabs by\npressing right or left arrow keys. For additional keyboard interactions, see the\n[Accessibility tab](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/tabs/accessibility).\n\n#### Automatic and manual\n\nAutomatic and manual tablists differ in how the tab items are activated.\n\nFor automatic tablists, focus and selection are synchronized. When the user\narrows to a tab, it becomes selected, and the tab panel under the tab updates\nautomatically. Use automatic tabs when tab panel content can load quickly,\nallowing for users to scan quickly through information to make a decision\nwithout latency.\n\nManual tablists allow the user to arrow between the tab items without updating\nthe tab panel underneath. When the user navigates using arrows, the selected tab\nremains selected while focus moves to the next tab. In order to select the\nfocused tab (and update the tabpanel under the tab), the user would press\n\n```\nEnter\n```\n\nCopy to clipboard\n\nor\n\n```\nSpace\n```\n\nCopy to clipboard\n\n. Use manual tabs when information in the tab panel will take\na longer time to load. This will allow a keyboard user or screen reader to\nnavigate through the tablist without having to wait for content to load. Learn\nmore about automatic verses manual tablists in the\n[Keyboard interactions](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/tabs/accessibility#keyboard-interactions)\nsection of the accessibility tab.\n\nFor additional information, see the\n[Accessibility tab](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/tabs/accessibility).\n\n### Responsive behavior\n\nIn responsive situations, horizontal tabs should not wrap to multiple lines or\nstack on top of each other; instead, they should scroll horizontally. Vertical\ntabs do not scroll horizontally because of their vertical persistent structure\nand always stack.\n\n#### Breakpoints\n\nWhen using tabs that have grid aware width alignment, they should follow these\nresponsive rules:\n\n- Max, XLG, and LG breakpoints: Use eight grid aware tabs or less.\n- MD and SM breakpoints: Grid aware tabs will automatically change to auto-width\n  alignment to reduce extra space on smaller screens.\n\n## Line tabs\n\nA line tab is standalone tab that can also be nested within components. Although\nit is commonly used within components, such as a modal or header, line tabs can\nalso be used for large content areas using the entire page for layout, not\nconnected to any other components. Line tabs are highly flexible and can be\nplaced on background or layer tokens, making it easy to use in many different\nscenarios. To help define the tab panel, which is the content area below the\nselected tab, a line can be used that extends from the tablist to the end of the\npanel. This is currently not part of the Carbon line tabs component and must be\nadded by teams if desired.\n\n![Examples of tabs with icons](/static/b62995d8b4e8b1d050e3bdba028b4572/3cbba/tab-usage-13.png)\n\n## Contained tabs\n\nContained tabs are an emphasized tab commonly used for defined content areas\nlike sub-pages. Contained tabs are always attached to a tab panel (background\ncontainer) that uses the same layer token as the selected tab. Since the\ncontained tabs are on layers, the tab content tends to stand out against the\nbackground and maintain a high visual hierarchy while line tabs tend to blend\ninto content more easily. Because of the layering model, be mindful of the\nlayers used within the tabs so the content does not get too visually\ncomplicated, especially within smaller areas.\n\n![Examples of contained tabs](/static/0cf62769d4e690929a1d96d2deea8d71/3cbba/tab-usage-14.png)\n\n## Vertical tabs\n\nVertical tabs are left and vertically-aligned tabs that allow a user to scan\nthrough information from top to bottom. This vertical orientation is good for\nquickly browsing and accessing information, such as a\n[get started](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/patterns/onboarding/orientation/usage#get-started)\npattern. Do not use vertical tabs in place of\n[navigation](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/UI-shell-left-panel/usage/).\n\nThe tab panel should stay the same height as tabs switch so content outside the\ntabs stays in a consistent place. The vertical tablist and panel height should\nbe determined by the tab that has the most content. To avoid excessive scrolling\nwithin the tab panel, do not overload it with too much content. If more space is\nneeded than the tab panel allows, consider using line or contained tabs that\nallow for full page layouts. Both the tablist and the tab panels are always on\nthe same layer. At extra large and large breakpoints, vertical tablist spans 4\ncolumns of the 16-column grid. At the medium breakpoint, the vertical tablist\nspans 2 columns. At the small breakpoint, the vertical tablist uses scrolling\ncontained tabs.\n\n![Example of vertical tabs in a get started pattern](/static/0372f0ff0fc3e908b5f763c82c1fa2dd/3cbba/tab-usage-21.png)\n\nExample of Vertical tabs in a get started pattern\n\n## Modifiers\n\n### Tabs with icons\n\nYou may use icons in either line or contained tabs. Icons are always pinned to\nthe right of the tab and do not appear above, below, or to the left of the\nlabel.\n\n![Examples of contained tabs with icons](/static/03f5eaad3af558e1de551d0de1f7a69a/3cbba/tab-usage-15.png)\n\nExample of contained tabs with icons.\n\n### Icon-only tabs\n\nYou may use icon-only tabs with both line and contained tabs. Icons must be\neasily recognized and globally accepted. These work best in small, defined\nspaces and in components. Always use a tooltip for an icon description on hover\nand focus to add clarity.\n\n![Example of icon-only tabs within a side panel](/static/215b4bb953ff627d29873c15d56852d5/3cbba/tab-usage-16.png)\n\nExample of icon-only tabs within a side panel.\n\n### Secondary labels\n\nContained tabs that align with the grid allow for a secondary label. Do not use\nsecondary labels with line tabs, auto-width contained tabs, or vertical tabs.\n\n![Example of contained tabs with a secondary labe and icon](/static/32d3cb624b4b2705e4cd6b0b2ba0bad2/3cbba/tab-usage-17.png)\n\nExample of contained tabs with a secondary label and icon.\n\n### Dismissible tabs\n\nDismissible tabs allow users to close tabs providing a focused and relevant\nexperience. Users can add or remove contained or line tabs as needed,\naccommodating future content additions or modifications without drastically\nchanging the overall layout or structure.\n\n![Dismissible tabs](/static/294b79256d174924c176b8764772080f/3cbba/tab-usage-18.png)\n\nExample of dismissible line tabs (top) and dismissible contained tabs (bottom)\n\n#### When to use\n\n- Use dismissible tabs to offer flexibility and scalability in complex\n  interfaces that require users to create multiple sections or modules.\n- Use dismissible tabs for content created or curated by the user.\n- Use to focus a specific data set or search results.\n\n#### When not to use\n\n- Do not use when tabs contain frequently used or critical information.\n- Do not use as navigation.\n\n#### Dismissible tabs with icons\n\nCarbon provides an option to include icons within the dismissible tabs. Only use\nicons within dismissible tabs if all tabs will include icons. Do not mix\ndismissible tabs without icons with dismissible tabs with icons.\n\n#### Dismissing a tab\n\nWhen dismissing a tab, an inline warning or modal may be used when information\ncontained in a tab will no longer be accessible or difficult to retrieve. Since\nwarnings, especially modals, are highly disruptive, only use when the dismissal\ncauses errors, unintentional deletions, or unsaved changes.\n\n#### Triggering a new tab\n\nThere are various ways to trigger a new tab. The trigger button can visually\nchange its shape and size depending on the use case. Keep the trigger close\nenough to the new tab to associate the add action with the new tab item. The\norder of tabs can be ascending or descending depending on use case but do keep\nthem in a sequential, logical order.\n\nIf all tabs are dismissible, make sure a user understands how to trigger new\ntabs once the tabs are gone. Provide visual cues, such as a container or\nplaceholder tab, so the user clearly understands that the trigger button is\ncreating a new tab in a place they expect.\n\n![Dismissible tabs](/static/88685145ecba1e4590a54bfcc6dad640/3cbba/tab-usage-19.png)\n\nExample of dismissible tabs within a UI utilizing a button to add a tab\n\n## Related\n\n#### Content switcher versus tabs\n\n[Content switchers](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/content-switcher/usage/)\nallow users to compare and toggle between alternate views of similar or related\ncontent. Content that is grouped into tabs is part of the same bigger context\nbut the content does not overlap.\n\n#### Progress indicator versus tabs\n\n[Progress indicator](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/progress-indicator/usage/)\ncontent moves in a logical progression, showing next steps to guide the user\nthrough the completion of a task. Tabs organize content into groups that the\nuser can navigate through; they do not support progressive tasks.\n\n## References\n\nJakob Nielson,\n[Tabs, Used Right](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tabs-used-right/) (Nielsen\nNorman Group, 2016)\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n\n[Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/edit/main/src/pages/components/tabs/usage.mdx)\n\n[Previous\n\nComponents: Structured list](/components/structured-list/usage/)\n\n[Next\n\nTabs: Style](/components/tabs/style/)",
