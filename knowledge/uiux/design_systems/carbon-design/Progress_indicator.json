They show which step the user is currently on, the total\nnumber of steps, and overall progress in completing a task.\nExample of a progress indicator used in a payment UI.\nWhen to use\nWhen the user is working through a linear process that can be organized into\nthree or more steps.\nWhen the user could benefit from understanding their progress on long forms\nsuch as eCommerce checkouts, onboarding, or visa applications.\nWhen user inputs should be validated before progressing to the next step.\nTo complement standard back/next navigation in a linear sequence.\nWhen not to use\nWhen a process or form has fewer than three steps.\nWhen the process may be completed in any order.\nWhen the number of steps may change based on conditional logic.\nFormatting\nAnatomy\nStatus indicator:\nCommunicates if a step is completed, current, not\nstarted, disabled or has an error. See the\nstatus indicator pattern\nfor guidance.\nActive step line:\nIndicates completed steps and the step the user is\ncurrently on.\nLabel:\nCommunicates what the user will accomplish in each step. Numbering\neach step also makes the progression more obvious.\nInactive step line:\nIndicates steps that are not started as well as steps\nthat are in an error, disabled, or skeleton state.\nHelper text:\nLabels a step as optional or in an error state.\nAlignment\nProgress indicators can be in vertical or horizontal positions depending on the\nuse case and the structure of the UI. When possible, arrange the progress\nindicator vertically for easier reading.\nExample of a progress indicator using vertical alignment.\nPlacement\nThe progress indicator component can be placed on a full page, in a modal, or in\na side panel. It is also common to use the progress indicator in a\ntearsheet\n,\na component provided by Carbon for IBM Products.\nExamples of progress indicators on a full page, tearsheet, and side panel.\nContent\nMain elements\nLabel\nThe label should communicate what the user will accomplish in each step in one\nor two words. One option is to clearly indicate the action of the step by using\nthe {verb} + {noun} content formula. For example, \u201cConfigure\nIdP\u201d or \u201cDefine endpoints.\u201d A label may use one word if it is universally\nunderstood, such as \u201cCart,\u201d \u201cShipping,\u201d or \u201cPayment.\u201d Avoid vague terms like\n\u201cProcessing.\u201d You may also number each step to make the progression more\nobvious.\nHelper text\nUse the helper text to indicate that a step is optional or that a step is in an\nerror state.\nOverflow content\nLabel\nWhen there is not enough space, consider rewording the label or truncate the\nlabel text with an ellipsis and provide a tooltip to convey additional\ninformation.\nHelper text\nLong helper text may wrap to a second line, and this is preferable to\ntruncation. Wrap the helper text beneath the label so that both maintain left\nalignment.\nExample of a helper text that wraps to the second line and maintains left alignment with the label.\nFurther guidance\nFor further content guidance, see Carbon\u2019s\ncontent guidelines\n.\nBehaviors\nStates\nThe progress indicator has seven states:\ncompleted\n,\ncurrent\n,\nnot\nstarted\n,\nerror\n,\ndisabled\n,\nhover\n, and\nfocus\n. View the\nStyle\ntab for visual specs of each\nstate and see the\nstatus indicator pattern\nfor additional\nguidance.\nState\nDescription\nCompleted\nA step is complete when a user has filled out the required information within a step and progressed to the following step. When possible, use validation to confirm that a step has been completed before the user continues. All steps that have been completed are indicated by an outlined circle with a checkmark and a blue active line.\nCurrent\nA step is current when a user is interacting with the information within that step. The current step the user is on is indicated by a half-filled circle and a blue active line.\nNot started\nA step is not started when a user has not yet interacted with that step. Steps the user has not encountered yet, or future steps, are indicated by an outlined circle and a gray active line.\nError\nA step may be in error when a user has entered invalid or incomplete information. There could also be a server-side error. Provide clear information about the error and guidance on how to resolve the issue.\nDisabled\nA step is disabled when all interactive functions have been removed. Unlike read-only states, disabled states are not focusable, are not read by screen readers, and do not need to pass visual contrast, making them inaccessible if they need to be interpreted.\nHover\nUse the hover state when a user\u2019s mouse cursor is hovering over the progress indicator\u2019s step.\nFocus\nWhen a user tabs to or clicks on the progress indicator\u2019s step, the step becomes focused, indicating the user has successfully navigated to the component.\nInteractions\nBy default, the progress indicator is not interactive, providing only a visual\nupdate of the users\u2019 progress. There is also an option for an interactive\nprogress indicator, which allows users to navigate to each step.\nMouse\nIf the progress indicator is interactive, users can navigate to a step by\nclicking anywhere within the step label container.\nKeyboard\nThe first step should be selected by default. Users can navigate between steps\nby pressing\nRight\nCopy to clipboard\nor\nLeft\nCopy to clipboard\narrow keys. For additional keyboard interactions,\nsee the\nAccessibility\ntab.\nValidation\nWhen possible, use validation to confirm that a step has been completed before\nthe user continues. If any entry is invalid, the progress indicator should show\nan error state. Additionally, the invalid entry should be marked with an error\nstate and include an inline error message that helps the user understand the\nproblem and how to fix it. This kind of inline validation (or client-side\nvalidation) should happen as soon as the field loses focus.\nIf the user cannot proceed due to a server-side issue, then an\ninline notification\nshould\nappear.\nExample of a progress indicator using validation.\nRelated\nThe progress indicator component is commonly used in\ndialogs\nor\nforms\n.\nIt is also common to use the progress indicator in a\ntearsheet\n,\na component provided by Carbon for IBM Products.\nFeedback\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\nGitHub\n.\nEdit this page on GitHub\nPrevious\nComponents: Progress bar\nNext\nProgress indicator: Style",
