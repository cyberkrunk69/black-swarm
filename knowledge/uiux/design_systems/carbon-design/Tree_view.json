Following on\nwith the tree analogy, the tree view component has branch nodes that can be\nexpanded or collapsed to reveal or hide child nodes. The tree may also have leaf\nnodes.

Instead, use the UI Shell left\npanel for product navigation. A combination of the\nUI shell left panel\nand the\nbreadcrumb\ncomponent can support an\ninformation architecture several levels deep.\nFeature flags\nA\nfeature flag\nhas been added to tree\nview to improve accessibility and changes parts of its functionality, not its\nvisual appearance. For code-specific feature flag information, refer to the\nCode\ntab. The current tree view is not being\ndeprecated, but teams are encouraged to use the feature flag tree view for their\nproducts moving forward. Once the next major release (v12) is released in the\nfuture, this feature flag will become the default version of the component.\nFormatting\nAnatomy\nThe tree view is composed of branch and leaf nodes that are designed to nest and\norganize large sets of information.\nBranch node\n: A node that has one or more child nodes. Can be expanded or\ncollapsed to reveal or hide child nodes.\nLeaf node\n: A node that has no child nodes and can appear at any level of\nthe tree view hierarchy. A leaf node may be referred to as a child node when\nit is nested underneath a branch node.\nCaret icon\n: An icon to expand or collapse a branch node.\nNode icon\n(optional): An icon to visually represent and support a node\nlabel, they can assist the user to scan different content types quickly.\nSizing\nThere are two node sizes: small (default), and extra small. Supporting two\ndifferent node sizes gives you more flexibility when structuring a tree view. If\nyou have a tree structure with complex nesting levels, use the extra small node\nsize to keep as much information in view as possible. When in doubt of which\nsize to use, use the small node size because it is our default.\nNode size\nHeight (px/rem)\nPurpose\nSmall\n32 / 2\nThis is the default size and is the most commonly used as it has similar geometries as the UI shell left navigation panel.\nExtra small\n24 / 1.5\nUse when space is constricted on the page and/or when you need a more condensed view to show more of the tree view on the screen.\nAlignment\nStacking nodes\nNodes stack directly on top of each other with 0px space between them. Having\nnodes flush with each other ensures consistent spacing and alignment between\neach node in the tree view.\nNesting nodes\nNested nodes in a tree view rely on vertical type and icon alignment to visually\ngroup nodes together. Branch icons and leaf icons sit to the left of type and\nalign vertically.\nContent\nMain elements\nYou may be able to label your nodes, or the labels may be generated from code.\nIf you have control of your label names, follow these guidelines.\nBranch node label\nBe brief but clear while summarizing what kind of child nodes the branch node\ncontains.\nLeaf node label\nBe brief and descriptive about what information the leaf node contains.\nOverflow content\nIf the node label is too long for one line in your tree view, add an ellipsis\n\u2026\nCopy to clipboard\nand accompany with a browser-based tooltip to show the full string of text.\nWhile truncation is not preferred, you can customize the view by\npositioning\nthe ellipsis at the\nfront-line, mid-line, or end-line of a node label depending on what information\nis most useful to the user to keep persistent in the tree view.\nFurther guidance\nFor further content guidance, see Carbon\u2019s\ncontent guidelines\n.\nBehaviors\nStates\nBranch nodes and leaf nodes share the same styles for different states. The only\ndifference between the structure of the two is the addition of a caret icon for\nexpanding or collapsing branch nodes.\nSelection indicator\nIf the branch node of a selected child node is collapsed, the parent node should\ninherit the selected state so the user does not lose the context of what is\nselected, even if it is out of view.\nExample of selected child node when the parent is open (left) and when the\nparent is collapsed (right).\nInteractions\nFocus\nWhen a single-select tree receives focus:\nFocus is set on the previously selected node.\nIf none of the nodes were selected before the tree receives focus, focus is\nset on the first node.\nExpanding and collapsing\nTo expand or collapse a branch node the user can click anywhere within the\ncaret icon bounding box.\nSelecting\nTo select a branch node the user can click anywhere on the node excluding the\ncaret icon bounding box.\nTo select a leaf node the user can click anywhere on the node container.\nKeyboard controls\nKey\nInteraction\nRight arrow\nWhen focus is on a closed node, opens the node; focus does not move.\nWhen focus is on an open node, moves focus to the first child node.\nWhen focus is on a leaf node, does nothing.\nLeft arrow\nWhen focus is on an open node, closes the node.\nWhen focus is on a child node that is also either a leaf node or a closed node, moves focus to its parent node.\nWhen focus is on a top level node that is also either a leaf node or a closed node, does nothing.\nDown arrow\nMoves focus to the next node that is focusable without opening or closing a node.\nUp arrow\nMoves focus to the previous node that is focusable without opening or closing.\nEnter\nActivates a node. In single-select trees where selection does not follow focus, the default action is typically to select the focused node.\nModifiers\nNode icons\nYou can add node icons to visually represent and support a written node label.\nWe recommend having consistent icon usage for all branch and leaf nodes. Make\nsure the icons accurately represent each node that they are related to. Using a\nfolder icon for branch nodes and a document icon for leaf nodes is a commonly\nrecognized pairing of icons used in tree view structures. If individual node\ndata cannot be identified, do not display icons. When in doubt, use nodes\nwithout icons.\nAligning icons\nIt is important when adding icons to nodes in a tree view that there is an icon\npresent for every node. Not having an icon for every branch or leaf node can\ncause alignment inconsistencies and make groupings of nodes harder to visualize.\nDo consistently use icons for each node in a tree view.\nDo not mix text-only and icon nodes in a tree view.\nRelated\nTree view versus accordion\nUse the\naccordion\ncomponent when you need to organize\nlengthy information in sections that only go one level deep. Tree view is best\nused for nesting categories of information in a hierarchy of multiple levels /\nin a hierarchical form.\nTree view versus UI Shell left panel\nUse the\nUI Shell left panel\ncomponent for product\nnavigation. A combination of the UI Shell left panel and the\nbreadcrumb\ncomponent can support an information\narchitecture several levels deep of a product. Tree view is best used for on\npage navigation instead of being used for architecture of a website or product.\nTree view versus data table\nUse the\ndata table\ncomponent for displaying\nlarge amounts of detailed information that is easy to scan horizontally in one\nview. Data table rows can be expanded, but we recommend only expanding a row one\nlevel deep. Tree view is used to organize multiple nested levels of information\nwith concise labels that do not need to be organized in a column structure.\nReferences\nTree\n(W3C Recommendation)\nTreeView\n(W3C Wiki 2012)\nTree view React app\n(WKC)\nTree view specifications\n(WKC)\nTree view WAI-ARIA practices\n(W3C)\nFeedback\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\nGitHub\n.\nEdit this page on GitHub\nPrevious\nComponents: Tooltip\nNext\nTree view: Style",
