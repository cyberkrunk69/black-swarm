These different statuses report the work that Carbon has done in the back end. These tests appear only when the components are stable.\n\n[##### Default state\n\nTested](//accessibility/#accessibility-testing-status)\n\n[##### Advanced states\n\nTested](//accessibility/#accessibility-testing-status)\n\n[##### Screen reader\n\nManually tested](//accessibility/#accessibility-testing-status)\n\n[##### Keyboard navigation\n\nTested](//accessibility/#accessibility-testing-status)\n\n## Overview\n\nBreadcrumbs show users their current location relative to the information\narchitecture and enable them to quickly move up to a parent level or previous\nstep.\n\n### When to use\n\nBreadcrumbs are effective in products and experiences that have a large amount\nof content organized in a hierarchy of more than two levels.

Both types are styled the same, but\nthe methods for populating the breadcrumb trail are different. The breadcrumb\ntype used should be consistent across a product.\n\n| Breadcrumb type | Purpose |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Location-based* | These illustrate the site\u2019s hierarchy and show the user where they are within that hierarchy. |\n| *Path-based* | These show the actual steps the user took to get to the current page, rather than reflecting the site\u2019s information architecture.

The\nsmall breadcrumb uses the\n\n```\n$label-01\n```\n\nCopy to clipboard\n\ntype token, while the medium breadcrumb\nuses the\n\n```\n$body-compact-01\n```\n\nCopy to clipboard\n\ntype token.\n\n![Breadcrumb sizing example](/static/c9626a1886bf5a05436faa48a317a2d9/3cbba/breadcrumb-sizing-1.png)\n\nSmall and medium sizes of breadcrumb\n\n#### Small size\n\nSmall breadcrumbs are commonly used in page headers.

They sit underneath\nthe header and navigation, but above the page title.\n\n![Breadcrumb placement in a UI](/static/ea6a5dbaf2a35407ea726d791ea94916/3cbba/breadcrumb-placement-1.png)\n\n## Content\n\n### Main elements\n\n#### Page link\n\n- Each page link should be short and clearly reflect the location or entity it\n  links to.\n- Start with the highest level parent page and move deeper into the information\n  architecture as the breadcrumb trail progresses.\n- By default, the current page is not listed in the breadcrumb trail.

If the current page is included in a breadcrumb trail, it\n  is always the last text listed and is not an interactive link.\n\n### Overflow content\n\nWhen space becomes limited, use an\n[overflow menu](/components/overflow-menu/usage) to truncate the breadcrumbs.\nThe first and last two page links should be shown, but the remaining breadcrumbs\nin between are condensed into an overflow menu. Breadcrumbs should never wrap\nonto a second line.\n\n![Truncated breadcrumbs](/static/e46af11dbcf54a02380e1777bafceed3/3cbba/breadcrumb-truncation.png)\n\n### Truncation\n\nFor most use cases at larger breakpoints, keep the first home breadcrumb link\nfor as long as possible in breakpoints, even when an overflow might be present.\nAlso for mobile or small viewpoints, start with the overflow first, following by\none breadcrumb.\n\n### Further guidance\n\nFor further content guidance, see Carbon\u2019s\n[content guidelines](/guidelines/content/overview).\n\n## Behaviors\n\n### Interactions\n\nAll the pages in the breadcrumb component should be interactive (except the\ncurrent page) and link to their respective pages.\n\n#### Mouse\n\nUsers can trigger an item by clicking on a breadcrumb page link.

If a\npage doesn\u2019t have a title or the current page is not clear, it can be included\nin the breadcrumb trail. If the current page is included in a breadcrumb trail,\nit is always the last text listed and is not an interactive link.\n\n![Breadcrumb showing current page](/static/7b261b32ed8897553f95c341b787a73a/3cbba/breadcrumb-modifiers-1.png)\n\n## Related\n\n- [Global header](/patterns/global-header)\n- [Progress indicator](/components/progress-indicator/usage/)\n- [UI shell header](/components/UI-shell-header/usage)\n- [Overflow menu](/components/overflow-menu/usage/)\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n\n[Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/edit/main/src/pages/components/breadcrumb/usage.mdx)\n\n[Previous\n\nComponents: AI label](/components/ai-label/usage/)\n\n[Next\n\nBreadcrumb: Style](/components/breadcrumb/style/)",
