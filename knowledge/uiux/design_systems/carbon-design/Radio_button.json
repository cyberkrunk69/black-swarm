A radio button can also be used for\nchanging settings in a menu or selecting a singular item in a data table.\nRadio buttons in a form should be placed at least 32px (\nlayout-03\nCopy to clipboard\n) below or\nbefore the next component. Spacing of 24px (\nlayout-02\nCopy to clipboard\n) or 16px (\nlayout-01\nCopy to clipboard\n)\ncan also be used when space is more restricted or if the form is more complex.\nFor more information on spacing in forms, see our\nform style guidance\n.\nSpacing between a radio button and other components in a form\nContent\nMain elements\nGroup labels (optional)\nA heading can accompany a set of radio buttons to provide further context or\nclarity.

Only\none radio button should be selected at a time. When a user chooses a new item,\nthe previous choice is automatically deselected. If the user has already\nselected an item but wants to deselect it, consider adding alternatives such as\nan \u201cother\u201d or \u201cnone\u201d option.\nIn addition to unselected and selected states, radio buttons also have states\nfor focus, disabled, read-only, error, and warning. When deciding whether to use\na disabled or read-only state for radio buttons, see our\nRead-only states pattern\nguidance.\nGroup states\nRadio button groups can receive the following states: read-only, disabled,\nerror, and warning, as well as the addition of helper text.\nInteractions\nMouse\nUsers can trigger an item by clicking the radio button input directly or by\nclicking the radio button label. Having both regions interactive creates a more\naccessible click target.\nKeyboard\nBy default, no option will be preselected. Users can navigate between radio\nbutton inputs by pressing\nUp\nCopy to clipboard\nor\nDown\nCopy to clipboard\narrow keys. If a user lands on a radio\nbutton set without a default indicator, they can press\nSpace\nCopy to clipboard\nto select the\nradio button or they can press an arrow key to select the next radio button.

The AI label can be placed on the radio button group\nlabel or on individual radio button labels.\nFor more information on designing for AI, see the\nCarbon for AI\nguidelines.\nRelated\nRadio buttons versus checkboxes\nRadio buttons allow users to select one option from a group of mutually\nexclusive choices, while checkboxes allow for a selection of one of more options\nfrom a group. In the use cases where multiple selections are allowed, use the\ncheckbox component\ninstead of the radio button.\nRadio button verses selectable tile\nRadio buttons should have concise, easy to compare options.
