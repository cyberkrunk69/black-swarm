It works best in forms when users choose an option from\nthe select list and submit data.\nA dropdown presents a list of options that users can select one or several\noptions from that list. Dropdown options are used for taking an action,\nfiltering, or sorting existing content.\nAnother important difference between the two components is the underlying code.\nThe select list appearance will be determined by the browser being used, while\nthe dropdown list can be styled as needed.\nExample of a select list of options for data submission on the left versus a\ndropdown list of actionable options on the right.\nVariants\nVariant\nPurpose\nDefault\nTypically used in forms with a variety of other components.\nInline select\nUsed when there are multiple select fields within a form.\nDefault select\nDefault selects are used in forms with other components.\nInline select\nInline select is useful when you have multiple select fields within a form.\nInline selects have less visual weight on a page because they are borderless.\nFormatting\nAnatomy\nDefault\nFluid\nLabels:\nText that informs the user what to expect in the list of dropdown\noptions.\nDefault option:\nAn empty option selected by default. The user can decide\nwhether to choose a different option from the list. Depending on the use\ncase, this defaulted behavior can be modified to be a prefilled selection to\nthe first option in the list, which is typically shown in alphabetical order,\nor the prefilled selection could be a frequent or commonly used option that\nis on the list.\nHelper text\n(optional, except for error and warning): Assistive text to\nhelp the user choose the right selection.

They share the same\nfunctionality but look visually different, influencing where to use them.\nStyle\nAppearance\nUse case\nDefault\nA traditional style where the label is positioned outside and above the input field.\nUse when white space is needed between input components or in productive moments where space is at a premium, and smaller components are needed.\nFluid\nAn alternative style where the label is placed inside of the input field and is stacked inline with the user input text.\nUse in expressive moments, fluid forms, contained spaces, or attached to complex components, like a toolbar.\nSizing\nDefault input heights\nThere are three default select height size for both variants: small, medium, and\nlarge. Supporting three different select sizes gives you more flexibility when\nstructuring layouts. However, use a consistent size for all form components on\nthe same page. For example, if you are using a medium size select also use the\nsame size text inputs, buttons, and so on. When in doubt, use the default medium\nsize height.\nDefault size\nHeight (px/rem)\nUse case\nSmall (sm)\n32 / 2\nUse when space is constricted or when placing a select in a form that is long and complex.\nMedium (md)\n40 / 2.5\nThis is the default size and the most commonly used size. When in doubt, use the medium size.\nLarge (lg)\n48 / 3\nUse when there is a lot of space to work with. The large size is typically used in simple forms or when a select is placed by itself on a page.\nFluid inputs heights\nIn the fluid select, there is only one input height. The list height is\ncontrolled by the browser.\nWidth\nThere is no minimum or maximum width for a select. The width can be customized\nappropriately for its context.\nContent\nMain elements\nLabel\nConcise labels for text and data inputs help users understand what information\nis being requested of them.\nLabels inform users what to expect in the list of select options.\nLabels are not helper text; be succinct. Use one to three words only.\nHelper text\nHelper text is pertinent information that assists the user in choosing the\nright selection from the select list.\nHelper text is optional but replaced with warning or error text when these\nstates appear.\nList order\nIf applicable, the list should be in alphabetical order or in increasing order\nrelative to the content. Otherwise, the order of the select list should be based\non the frequency of use.\nUniversal behaviors\nStates\nThe select has multiple interactive states for both default and inline variants:\nenabled\n,\nhover\n,\nselected\n,\nfocus\n,\nopen\n,\nerror\n,\nwarning\n,\ndisabled\n, skeleton, and\nread-only\n.\nState\nWhen to use\nEnabled\nWhen the select is live and a user is not directly interacting with it. This is commonly referred to as the default or normal state of the component. An enabled select field should contain a default value.\nHover\nWhen a user\u2019s mouse cursor is hovering over the field.\nSelected\nWhen a user opens the list and selects an option within the list.\nFocus\nWhen a user tabs to or clicks on the select field, the field becomes focused, indicating the user has successfully navigated to the component.\nOpen\nWhen a user opens the list.\nError\nWhen a select component marked as \u201crequired\u201d has not had an option selected. It can also be triggered due to a system error. This state requires a user response before data can be submitted or saved.\nWarning\nWhen you need to call the user\u2019s attention to an exception condition. The condition might not be an error but can cause problems if not resolved.\nDisabled\nWhen the user cannot interact with a component and all interactive functions have been removed. Unlike read-only states, disabled states are not focusable, are not read by screen readers, and do not need to pass visual contrast, making them inaccessible if they need to be interpreted.\nSkeleton\nUsed on an initial page load to indicate that the select has not yet fully loaded.\nRead-only\nWhen the user can review but not modify the component. This state removes all interactive functions like the disabled state but can still be focusable, accessible by screen readers, and passes visual contrast for readability.\nDefault\nFluid\nInteractions\nMouse\nUsers can open and close the list by clicking the chevron icon or clicking\nanywhere within the field. To select an option, the user can click anywhere\ninside an option list.\nDefault\nFluid\nKeyboard\nThe dropdown field is the element that receives focus. All keyboard\ninteractions happen from this element.\nUsers can open the list by pressing\nSpace\nCopy to clipboard\n,\nEnter\nCopy to clipboard\n, the\nDown arrow\nCopy to clipboard\n, or the\nUp arrow\nCopy to clipboard\n.\nUsers can move the highlighted option to the next option by pressing the\nDown arrow\nCopy to clipboard\n.\nUsers can move the highlighted option to the previous option by pressing the\nUp arrow\nCopy to clipboard\n.\nUsers can close the list by pressing\nEscape\nCopy to clipboard\n,\nSpace\nCopy to clipboard\n, or\nEnter\nCopy to clipboard\n.\nDefault\nFluid\nValidation\nInvalid\nReal-time validation helps to streamline the process of filling out a form. The\nerror state is triggered if the data is invalid or a required field is left\nempty. The error state has three visual indicators to signify invalid content: a\nred border, an error icon indicator, and an error message.\nDefault\nFluid\nAI presence\nSelect has a modification that takes on the AI visual styling when the AI label\nis present in the input. The AI variant functions the same as the normal version\nexcept with the addition of the AI label which is both a visual indicator and\nthe trigger for the explainability popover.\nFor more information on designing for AI, see the\nCarbon for AI\nguidelines.\nDefault\nFluid\nRevert to AI\nA select can toggle between the AI variant and the non-AI variant depending on\nthe user\u2019s interaction. If the user manually overrides the AI-suggested content\nthen the input will change from the AI variant to the non-AI variant. Once\nedited, the user should still be able to switch back to the initially AI\ngenerated content via a revert to AI button.\nDefault\nFluid\nRelated\nIf there are fewer than three options to choose from, use a\nradio button\ngroup instead.\nIf multi-select is necessary, use\ndropdown\ninstead.\nDropdown options are used to take an action, navigating outside of the current\ncontext, filtering or sorting existing content.\nFeedback\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\nGitHub\n.\nEdit this page on GitHub\nPrevious\nComponents: Search\nNext\nSelect: Style",
