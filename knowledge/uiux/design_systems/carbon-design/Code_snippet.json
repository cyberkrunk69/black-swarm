The\nbrowser also provides an ability to manually highlight the text and choose\n\u201ccopy\u201d from the context menu (right click).\nA multi-line code snippet can be copied by clicking on the copy icon or by\nmanually highlighting the text and right clicking \u201ccopy\u201d.\nKeyboard\nCopy button:\nAn inline code snippet, and the copy button of the single line and multiline\nsnippets can be focused by pressing\nTab\nCopy to clipboard\n.\nThe copy functionality can be activated by pressing either\nSpace\nCopy to clipboard\nor\nEnter\nCopy to clipboard\n.\nAfter the copy is activated, the focus remains on the button since there is no\nchange in context.\nShow more button:\nThe \u201cShow more\u201d ghost button in the multi-line code snippet can be focused by\npressing\nTab\nCopy to clipboard\n.\nShow more or less code by pressing\nSpace\nCopy to clipboard\nor\nEnter\nCopy to clipboard\nwhile the ghost button\nis in focus.\nFor additional keyboard interactions, see the\naccessibility tab\n.\nInline\nUse inline code snippets within bodies of text. Using code snippets inline helps\ncreate emphasis on important key words to copy and makes long bodies of text\neasier to scan. Refrain from having inline code snippets that extend to multiple\nlines.\nSingle line\nUse single line code snippets for longer strings of code that can still be\npresented on one line.\nSingle line overflow content\nIf the text in a single line code snippet is lengthy, the text overflows into a\nhorizontal scroll.\nMulti-line\nUse multi-line code snippets for displaying multiple lines of code.\nMulti-line overflow content\nShow more button\nA Show more ghost button can be added to a multi-line code snippet to show more\nor fewer lines of code.
