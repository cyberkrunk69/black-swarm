For more information on states, visit the\ninteractive state\nguidance on the style tab.\nState\nWhen to use\nEnabled\nWhen the slider is live, and a user is not directly interacting with it. The enabled state is commonly referred to as the default or normal state of the component.\nHover\nWhen a user\u2019s mouse cursor is hovering over the fields or handles of the slider component. Use a tooltip on hover if the slider does not have number inputs to show the selected values\nFocus\nWhen a user tabs to or clicks on a field or handle, it becomes focused, indicating the user has successfully navigated to the component. Use a tooltip on focus if the slider does not have number inputs to show the selected values.\nActive\nWhen a user is pressing down on the handles of the slider component and interacting with it. Use a tooltip on active if the slider does not have number inputs to show the selected values.\nError\nWhen a slider component marked as \u201crequired\u201d has not had an option selected, if the selected values are out of range, or if the values are not numbers . It can also be triggered due to a system error. This state requires a user response before data can be submitted or saved.\nWarning\nWhen you need to call the user\u2019s attention to an exception condition. The condition might not be an error but can cause problems if not resolved.\nDisabled\nWhen the user cannot interact with a component and all interactive functions have been removed. Unlike read-only states, disabled states are not focusable, are not read by screen readers, and do not need to pass visual contrast, making them inaccessible if they need to be interpreted.\nRead-only\nWhen the user can review but not modify the component. This state removes all interactive functions like the disabled state but can still be focusable, accessible by screen readers, and passes visual contrast for readability.\nInteractions\nMouse\nUsers can trigger a value change by clicking anywhere on the horizontal track.\nUsers can also drag the slider handle. Either method repositions the slider and\nautomatically updates the value in the number input for the single slider. The\nclosest value (minimum or maximum value) will be updated depending on where the\nuser clicks on the range slider. Either method repositions the slider and\nautomatically updates the value in the number input.\nKeyboard (default slider)\nUsers can enter an exact numeric value into the number input field or use the\nup\nCopy to clipboard\n,\ndown\nCopy to clipboard\n,\nleft\nCopy to clipboard\n, or\nright\nCopy to clipboard\narrow keys to change the value. Either method\nadjusts the slider handle to the corresponding position.\nUsers can also increment the value by using the arrow keys when the slider\nreceives focus. The arrow keys, in combination with the\nshift\nCopy to clipboard\nkey can alter\nthe slider by the value of the\nstepMultiplier\nCopy to clipboard\n.\nKeyboard (range slider)\nOnce focus is established on the range slider, the user can define a numerical\nrange by:\nEntering the exact value into the text field.\nMoving the slider handle with their mouse, which automatically updates the\nvalue in the number input.\nUsing the\nup\nCopy to clipboard\n,\ndown\nCopy to clipboard\n,\nleft\nCopy to clipboard\n, or\nright\nCopy to clipboard\narrow keys automatically updates\nthe value in the number input and moves the slider handle to the corresponding\nvalue.\nThe step size increment is how many increments the inputted value and slider\nhandle will jump when using the arrow keys.
