## Formatting

#### Text

The text within an overflow menu should be direct so users can quickly decide on
an action. Actions that could cause a significant change to the user’s data
(delete app, delete service, etc.) are separated by a divider and live below the
primary set of actions.

### Placement

Depending on where the Overflow menu appears within the UI, the tab tip may
appear on the left or right so it always remains visible.
