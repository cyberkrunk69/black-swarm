Number inputs incrementally increase or decrease the value with a\ntwo-segment control. Number input reduces input efforts for adjusting small\nvalues.\nWhen to use\nThe user needs to input a numeric value\nAdjusting small values when increasing or decreasing them requires only a few\nclicks\nWhen users may not know exact values and only want to change the values that\nare relative to its current state\nWhen not to use\nIt is best practice not to use number input if large value changes are\nexpected. For example, when the value sets from 1 to 30, number input is not a\ngreat option because it requires many clicks to reach 30. In this case, use\nslider\nwhen numeric\nvalues are large or when there is a wide range of numeric options.\nIt is also best to avoid number input for continuous variables such as prices,\ndistances, lengths, or human heights. When the exact value is important to\nspecify within a wide range, use\ntext input\ninstead.\nFormatting\nAnatomy\nDefault\nFluid\nLabel\n: Text that informs the user about the content they need to enter in\nthe field. It is required unless you get an approved accessibility exemption.\nNumeric value\n: The value changes when user enters a value into the field\nor uses the subtract or add controls.\nHelper text\n: Assistive text that can provide additional aid or context to\nthe user. Often used to explain the correct data format.\nField\n: The container in which a user enters data.\nSubtract icon\n: This icon triggers decremental values.\nAdd icon\n: This icon triggers incremental values.\nStatus icon\n: Indicates the state of the number input, either error or\nwarning.\nError or Warning text\n: It replaces the helper text when an error or\nwarning state appears.\nStyling\nThere are two styles of number inputs, default and fluid. They share the same\nfunctionality but look visually different, influencing where to use them.\nStyle\nAppearance\nUse case\nDefault\nA traditional style where the label is positioned outside and above the input field.\nUse when white space is needed between input components or in productive moments where space is at a premium, and smaller components are needed.\nFluid\nAn alternative style where the label is placed inside of the input field and is stacked inline with the user input text.\nUse in expressive moments, fluid forms, contained spaces, or attached to complex components, like a toolbar.\nA default style input is shown on the left and fluid style is on the right.\nSizing\nDefault input heights\nNumber input has three sizes default input heights:\nsmall\n,\nmedium\n, and\nlarge\n. The width varies in size based on content, layout, and design.\nSize\nHeight (px/rem)\nUse case\nSmall (sm)\n32 / 2\nUse when space is constricted or when placing a number input in a form that is long and complex.\nMedium (md)\n40 / 2.5\nThis is the default size and the most commonly used size. When in doubt, use the medium size.\nLarge (lg)\n48 / 3\nUse when there is a lot of space to work with. The large size is typically used in simple forms or when a number input is placed by itself on a page.\nFluid input heights\nThere is only one fluid input height and it is visually larger than the default\nheights. The input is a set height of 64px except when a warning or error\nmessage has been added to the bottom.\nContent\nMain elements\nLabel\nAlways include a label so that users know how to complete the field\nKeep the label short and concise\nUse sentence-style capitalization for the label\nDo include a label\nDo not hide a label that helps user understand the context of number input\nHelper text\nIndicates the input value if it has a maximum or minimum\nHelper text is optional but if present will be replaced by warning and error\nmessages when needed\nOverflow content\nLabel, numeric value, and helper text should be short and not exceed two lines.\nBehaviors\nStates\nThe number input has a series of states for both field and controls elements:\nenabled\n,\nhover\n,\nfocus\n,\nerror\n,\nwarning\n,\ndisabled\n, and\nread-only\n.\nState\nWhen to use\nEnabled\nWhen the number input is live but a user is not directly interacting with it. This is commonly referred to as the default or normal state of the component. An enabled number input field should contain a default value.\nHover\nWhen a user\u2019s mouse cursor is hovering over the field or the button controls.\nFocus\nWhen a user tabs to or clicks on the number input, the field or controls become focused, indicating the user has successfully navigated to the component.\nError\nWhen the required number input has not been filled in. It can also be triggered due to a system error. This state requires a user response before data can be submitted or saved.\nWarning\nWhen you need to call the user\u0000\u0000\u2019s attention to an exception condition. The condition might not be an error but can cause problems if not resolved.\nDisabled\nWhen the user cannot interact with a component and all interactive functions have been removed. Unlike read-only states, disabled states are not focusable, are not read by screen readers, and do not need to pass visual contrast, making them inaccessible if they need to be interpreted.\nSkeleton\nUse on an initial page load to indicate that the number input has not yet fully loaded.\nRead-only\nWhen the user can review but not modify the component. This state removes all interactive functions like the disabled state but can still be focusable, accessible by screen readers, and passes visual contrast for readability.\nDefault\nFluid\nInteractions\nMouse\nUsers can click on the input field and change the value by typing inside the\ninput field. Users can also increase or decrease the values by pressing on the\nadd or subtract icon controls.\nDefault\nFluid\nKeyboard\nUsers can navigate to the number input field by pressing\nTab\nCopy to clipboard\n. Users can then\nincrease the value by pressing\nUp arrow\nCopy to clipboard\nor decrease the value by pressing\nDown arrow\nCopy to clipboard\n.\nValidation\nInvalid\nAn error state is triggered if the data is invalid or a required field is left\nempty. Error states have three visual indicators to signify invalid content: a\nred border, an error icon indicator, and an error message.\nDefault values\nNumeric input should always have a default. The default will usually be \u20181\u2019.\nSometimes, you will have input value defaulted to \u20180\u2019. For example, when booking\na hotel room, it may set the default number of adults as \u20181\u2019 and the default\nnumber of children as \u20180\u2019.\nDo set a clear default that most users are likely to select\nDo not leave value input blank\nAI presence\nNumber input has a modification that takes on the AI visual styling when the AI\nlabel is present in the input. The AI variant of number input functions the same\nas the normal version except with the addition of the AI label which is both a\nvisual indicator and the trigger for the explainability popover.\nFor more information on designing for AI, see the\nCarbon for AI\nguidelines.\nDefault\nFluid\nRevert to AI\nA number input can toggle between the AI variant and the non-AI variant\ndepending on the user\u2019s interaction. If the user manually overrides the\nAI-suggested content then the input will change from the AI variant to the\nnon-AI variant. Once edited, the user should still be able to switch back to the\ninitially AI generated content via a revert to AI button.\nDefault\nFluid\nRelated\nUse\nslider\nwhen\nnumeric values are large or when there is a wide range of numeric options.\nWhen the exact value is important to specify within a wide range, use\ntext input\ninstead.\nReferences\nYuxuan (Tammy) Zhou,\nDesign Guidelines for Input Steppers\n(Nielsen Norman Group, 2018)\nFeedback\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\nGitHub\n.\nEdit this page on GitHub\nPrevious\nComponents: Notification\nNext\nNumber input: Style",
