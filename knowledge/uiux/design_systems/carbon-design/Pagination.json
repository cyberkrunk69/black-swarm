In some cases, the height sizes of\nthese two components will not be the same because we do not offer extra small\nand extra large sizes for pagination. When using the extra large data table row\nheight, use the large pagination. When using the extra small data table row\nheight, use the small pagination.\nSize pairings of the pagination and data table components\nPlacement\nPlace the pagination near the related component or area of the page where the\ninformation will be paginated.\nPlacing pagination with data table\nWhen using the pagination variant with a data table, the pagination should be\nstacked and below the table with no padding between them.\nPlacement of the pagination variant\nDo stack the pagination component below the data table.\nDo not stack the pagination component above the data table.\nPlacing pagination nav on a page\nWhen using the pagination nav variant on a page, float it below the content to\nwhich it is paginating and related to. The pagination can be right aligned or\nleft aligned to the content above it. When it doubt, choose right alignment.\nPlacement of the pagination nav variant\nContent\nMain elements\nLabel text\nThe label text in the pagination component should be concise and instructional.\nIt describes the items per page and the number of pages or items. We recommend\nnot modifying the label text unless necessary for specific use cases.\nSelect component option text\nThe select components option text is shown as a number, indicating the items per\npage and the current page. Alternatively, this can be indicated as a word for\nthe \u201cItems per page\u201d selection instead of a number.\nOverflow content\nIn the pagination nav variant, an ellipsis button appears between pages to\nindicate that there are numerous pages to navigate to within the ellipsis button\nmenu. We recommend never placing the ellipsis button at the beginning or end of\na series of pages in the pagination component.\nExample of the ellipsis button for overflow content in the pagination nav\nvariant\nFurther guidance\nFor further content guidance, see Carbon\u2019s\ncontent guidelines\n.\nPagination\nThe pagination variant is typically a bar attached to the bottom of a data table\nto paginate its data.\nExample of the pagination variant in a UI\nStates\nThe pagination variant has the select component and ghost icon button component\nnested within it and inherits their component states.

The select components have been\nremoved at the small breakpoint, but information on the total number of items,\nitems being displayed, and previous and next buttons remain.\nPagination variant responsive behavior in all breakpoints versus the small\nbreakpoint\nClickable areas\nWithin the pagination variant, there are four clickable areas. Two select\ncomponents allow you to change the number of items per page and the page number.\nTwo ghost icon buttons take you to the previous or next page.\nPagination variant clickable areas\nPagination nav\nThe pagination nav variant is most commonly used to paginate full pages or\nsections of content on a page. It floats under and near the related content.\nExample of the pagination nav variant in a UI\nStates\nThe pagination nav variant has the ghost icon button component and the\nbreadcrumb overflow button component nested within it that inherits their\ncomponent states. For more information on these states, refer to the\nselect\nand\nbreadcrumb overflow button\nstyle tab guidance.\nInteractions\nMouse\nClicking on a button number will navigate you to that page.\nClicking on a previous or next caret button will navigate you to the previous\nand next pages of the one you are currently viewing.\nClicking on an overflow ellipsis button will open a select menu to choose a\npage to navigate to.

Two ghost icon buttons\ntake you to the previous or next page. The rest of the page number buttons take\nyou to that particular page.\nClickable areas within the pagination nav variant\nModifiers\nPage looping\nFor the pagination nav variant, instead of turning off the previous or next\ncaret buttons when you reach either the first or last page of the pagination\ncomponent, you can enable the option to loop through the available pages\ncontinuously.\nPage naming\nBy default, the select component option text is displayed as a number, showing\nitems per page and the current page. However, we offer an alternative option to\nuse a word instead of a number for the \u201cItems per page\u201d selection if that better\nmeets your requirements.\nSelect components content alternative of numbers versus words\nRelated\nData table\nFeedback\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\nGitHub\n.\nEdit this page on GitHub\nPrevious\nComponents: Number input\nNext\nPagination: Style",
