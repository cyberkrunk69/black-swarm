You can use a parent\ncheckbox to make a bulk selection of all list items. Unchecking the parent\ndeselects all of the list items. Alternatively, you can select children\nindividually when the parent is not selected, which is where the indeterminate\nstate comes in to play.\nExample of a full page filter list\nWhen not to use\nIf a user can select only one option from a list, radio buttons should be used\ninstead of checkboxes.

If there is a\ncheckbox grouping, they can be laid out vertically or horizontally depending on\nthe use case and the structure of the UI. When possible, arrange the checkbox\nand radio button groups vertically for easier reading.\nVertically stacked versus horizontal alignment\nPlacement\nThe checkbox component is often used in forms. Forms can be placed on a full\npage, in a modal or in a side panel. A checkbox can also be used for agreeing to\nterms and conditions or to filter information.\nCheckboxes in a form should be placed at least 32px (\nlayout-03\nCopy to clipboard\n) below or\nbefore the next component. Spacing of 24px (\nlayout-02\nCopy to clipboard\n) or 16px (\nlayout-01\nCopy to clipboard\n)\ncan also be used when space is more restricted or if the form is more complex.\nFor more information on spacing in forms, see our\nform style guidance\n.\nSpacing between a checkbox and other components in a form\nFor more information about spacing for the checkbox component itself, see the\nstyle tab\n.\nContent\nMain elements\nGroup labels (optional)\nIn most cases, a set of checkboxes is preceded by a group label to provide\nfurther context or clarity.\nA group label can either state the category of the grouping or describe what\nactions to take below.\nUse sentence case for group labels.\nIn some cases, a group of checkboxes may be within a larger group of\ncomponents that already have a group label. In this case, an additional group\nlabel for the checkbox component itself is not needed.\nCheckbox labels\nAlways use clear and concise labels for checkboxes.\nLabels appear to the right of checkbox inputs.\nRegardless of whether the label is visible in the interface, a label is always\nneeded in code, whether it\u2019s for one checkbox or a group of them. See the\ncheckbox code tab\nfor more information.\nOverflow content\nWe recommend checkbox labels being fewer than three words.\nIf you are tight on space, consider rewording the label. Do not truncate\ncheckbox label text with an ellipsis.\nLong labels may wrap to a second line, and this is preferable to truncation.\nText should wrap beneath the checkbox so the control and label are top\naligned.\nDo let text wrap beneath the checkbox so the control and label are top aligned.\nDo not vertically center wrapped text with the checkbox.\nFurther guidance\nFor further content guidance, see Carbon\u2019s\ncontent guidelines\n.\nBehaviors\nStates\nThe checkbox input allows for a series of states:\nunselected\n,\nselected\n,\nand\nindeterminate\n. The default view of a set of checkboxes is having no\noption selected.\nUse the indeterminate state when the checkbox contains a sublist of selections,\nsome of which are selected, and some unselected. In addition to unselected,\nselected, and indeterminate states, checkboxes also have states for focus,\ndisabled, read-only, error, and warning. When deciding whether to use a disabled\nor read-only state for checkboxes, see our\nRead-only states pattern\nguidance.\nGroup states\nCheckbox groups can receive the following states: read-only, disabled, error,\nand warning, as well as the addition of helper text.\nNesting\nCheckboxes can be nested when a parent and child relationship is needed. Users\ncan either select an entire set of options or only a subset.\nChecking the parent checkbox automatically selects all of the nested children\ncheckboxes. Unchecking the parent checkbox automatically deselects all of the\nchildren checkboxes.\nChecking a child checkbox, if at least one other child checkbox is not selected,\nautomatically puts the parent checkbox into the indeterminate state. Unchecking\na child checkbox, when all other children checkboxes remain selected, switches\nthe parent checkbox from the default checked state to the indeterminate state.\nInteractions\nMouse\nUsers can trigger an item by clicking the checkbox input directly or by clicking\nthe checkbox label. Having both regions interactive creates a more accessible\nclick target. The only hover effect when the mouse is placed over the target is\na pointer shape change.\nKeyboard\nUsers can navigate to and between checkbox inputs by pressing\nTab\nCopy to clipboard\nor\nShift-Tab\nCopy to clipboard\n. Users can trigger a state change by pressing\nSpace\nCopy to clipboard\nwhile the\ncheckbox input has focus. For additional keyboard interactions, see the\naccessibility tab\n.\nAI presence\nCheckbox has a modification that embeds the AI label when AI is present in the\ncontrol. The AI variant functions the same as the normal version except with the\naddition of the AI label which is both a visual indicator and the trigger for\nthe explainability popover. The AI label can be placed on the checkbox group\nlabel or on individual checkbox labels.\nFor more information on designing for AI, see the\nCarbon for AI\nguidelines.\nRelated\nCheckbox versus radio button\nRadio buttons represent a group of\nmutually exclusive\nchoices, while\ncheckboxes allow users to select one or more checkboxes from a group. In use\ncases where only one selection of a group is allowed, use the radio button\ncomponent instead of the checkbox.\nCheckbox versus toggle switch\nToggle switches are preferred when the resulting action will be instantaneously\napplied, without the need for further confirmation. By comparison, checkboxes\nrepresent one input in a larger flow which usually requires a final confirmation\nstep.\nTables\nSee the\ndata table component\nfor guidance on how to use checkboxes within a table.\nReferences\nData table\nForm\nRadio button\nToggle\nFeedback\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\nGitHub\n.\nEdit this page on GitHub\nPrevious\nComponents: Button\nNext\nCheckbox: Style",
