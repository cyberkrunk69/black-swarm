Default toggles appear in forms or within full pages of information.\nSmall toggle\nUse the small toggle when you do not need to specify label or state text. Small toggles are more compact in size and are used inline with other components.\nFeature flags\nA\nfeature flag\nhas been added to the\ntoggle to adjust its label spacing and changes its visual appearance, not its\nfunctionality. For code-specific feature flag information, refer to the\nCode\ntab. The current toggle is not being\ndeprecated, but teams are encouraged to use the feature flag toggle for their\nproducts moving forward. Once the next major release (v12) is released in the\nfuture, this feature flag will become the default version of the component.\nThe following is the feature flag change made to the toggle.\nThe spacing between the toggles label and its container is now 8px instead of\n16px to improve consistency across our label spacing in other components.\nThis change applies to both the default and small toggles.\nFlag enabled\nFlag disabled\nFormatting\nAnatomy\nDefault and small toggles are both comprised of a label text, a toggle button,\nand a state text. Default toggles are required to display a component label and\nstate text, unlike the small toggle, where both these elements are optional. The\nsmall toggle displays a checkmark tick in the \u201con\u201d state to ensure the toggle is\nstill accessible when label and state text are unavailable.\nAnatomy of default and small toggle\n1.
