It helps organize and present grouped information into logical\nand scannable patterns. The content within a structured list can be stacked to\ncreate hierarchy within the data.

If you have complex content that needs to be shown, consider\n  using a\n  [data table](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/data-table/usage/),\n  which supports nesting items and presents a larger set of content.\n- If needing to use a list of items in a small or confined space rather than on\n  a full page, consider using a\n  [contained list](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/contained-list/usage/)\n  instead.\n\n### Variants\n\n| Variant | Purpose |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Default](#default) | Allows the user to quickly browse and view information within a group of data. |\n| [Selectable](#selectable) | Allows the user to select a desired option within a group of data.
