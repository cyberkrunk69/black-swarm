These different statuses report the work that Carbon has done in the back end. These tests appear only when the components are stable.\nDefault state\nTested\nAdvanced states\nTested\nScreen reader\nManually tested\nKeyboard navigation\nNot available\nOverview\nA progress bar indicates that the user\u2019s request has been received and the\napplication is making progress toward completing the requested action. Progress\nbars inform users about the status of ongoing processes, the estimated time of\nhow long a process will take, or if a request is being executed.\nWhen to use\nFor a long operation or a process that can take a considerable or unknown\namount of time\nWhen the process can be described with quantitative information, such as a\npercentage\nTo visually show the progression of a system operation such as downloading,\nuploading, loading data, submitting a form, or saving updates\nTo convey that data is being requested, transferred, or processed\nWhen not to use\nWhen the load time is expected to display expanded information, use\nskeleton states\ninstead\nWhen manual user actions are required to progress, use a\nprogress indicator\ninstead\nWhen the progress is determined by user actions such as tutorials completed,\nor storage space, rather than system actions\nIf the process takes less than 5 seconds to load, use\nloading\ninstead.\nVariants\nA progress bar can either be determinate or indeterminate. The determinate\nvariant is visualized as a track on which a bar fills up from left to right\nrepresenting the progress. The indeterminate variant is visualized as a track on\nwhich a bar is moving along in constant speed, repeating over time.\nVariant\nPurpose\nDeterminate\nUse determinate progress bars where there is clear information about the progression \u2014 they convey exact and qualitative information about the progression.\nIndeterminate\nUse indeterminate progress bars where there is unclear information about the progression \u2014 they convey that users\u2019 request, action, or data is being processed at the moment without indicating how long the activity will take.\nDeterminate progress bars fill from 0 to 100%.\nIndeterminate progress bars move along a fixed track continually until the process is complete.\nDeterminate progress bar\nDeterminate progress bars are used when the loading progress can be tracked and\ntranslated into a bar indicator which fills the track from 0% to 100% and never\ndecreases in value or resets.\nUse a determinate progress bar when the progress can be calculated against a\nspecific goal. For example, when downloading a file of a known size.\nIndeterminate progress bar\nIndeterminate progress bars are used when the loading progress is unknown or the\namount of wait time can\u2019t be calculated.\nOnce triggered, the bar indicator will quickly and repeatably move from left to\nright (Carbon reserves back and forth motions for\nskeletons\n), while data is being\ngathered during the first stages of the load. In this scenario, a percentage\nvalue would not be present. This bar may change to a determinate indicator if\nenough information is gathered to calculate the load completion. The final\ndeterminate stage of the load is used to visually indicate the completion of the\ntask to the user.\nPlay\nProgress status\nIt\u2019s best to give the user transparency about the process which usually leads to\nincreased trust in the software or platform. However, it may not be possible to\nprovide progress estimation in certain cases. If progress data is not available,\nan indeterminate progress bar can be used.\nAs a more concrete set of examples, there are generally three different major\nprogressions of a system operation: downloading, uploading, and local\nprocessing.\nDownloading\nFor downloading actions, it\u2019s usually possible to get a value of progress and\nupdate it in real time for a determinate progress bar. Depending on the\ninformation reported from a data source, time remaining could be estimated based\non how much has been downloaded so far over a time period.\nUploading\nUpload actions may be unable to report real time progress status depending on\nthe data source and API configuration. However, always strive to provide users\nthe determinate value whenever it\u2019s possible to inform them about the process.\nData processing\nData processing refers to manipulations of data to produce meaningful\ninformation. This can include currency exchange, file generation, data\nreformatting, or similar operations. Depending on the operation, time estimated\nor cycles to complete processing could be used to populate a determinate\nprogress bar.\nFormatting\nAnatomy\nLabel:\nThe text describes the process that the progress bar refers to.\nThe label can be visually hidden, but must be defined in order to be\naccessible.\nHelper text (optional, except for error):\nAssistive text to show\nadditional information about the process taking place. For determinate, the\ntext is usually a percentage, fraction, ratio, or numeric value showing\nprogression. Such values are not applicable when a progress bar is\nindeterminate. A progress bar that receives an error status must convey the\nproblem in the error helper text.\nTrack:\nThe static area that the bar indicator moves on top of and acts as\na fixed visual reference of what the total length and duration of the process\ncould be.\nBar indicator:\nIndicates how much the process has progressed.\nStatus icon:\nIndicates the status of the progress bar, either in error or\nsuccess status.\nSizing\nHeight\nThe progress bar is offered in two different sizes\u2014big (8px) and small (4px).\nThe big progress bar height is typically used when there is large amounts of\nspace on a page. The small progress bar height is commonly used when space is\nrestricted and can be placed within cards, data tables, or side panels.\nWidth\nThe width of a progress bar can vary based on the content. The minimum width of\na progress bar is 48px and keep its width to a maximum of six columns when\npossible. If the progress bar width is too long, it can reduce readability.\nDon\u2019t increase the progress bar length to fill the entire width of a window or\napplication.\nDo keep a width within six columns.\nDo not exceed a width of six columns.\nText alignment\nText alignment depends on the context and area given. Progress bar can have\nthree ways for text alignment: default, inline, and indent. Indent alignment\nshould only be used inside containers, tiles, or side panels which the progress\nbar will extend to the edges.\nA few common examples of text alignment for progress bars\nText alignment\nUse case\nDefault\nFull page, cards, dialogs\nInline\nData table\nIndent\nSide panels, cards (usually on dashboard)\nText placement\nLabels should always be placed above the progress bar for readability, and\nhelper text below or beside. Avoid placing text inside the progress bar\nindicator or track. This visual could cause clutter and inconsistency in text\nalignment. Meanwhile, placing the text far away from the progress bar could\ncause confusion in the context.\nDo place text close to the progress bar.\nDo not embed text into the progress bar.\nDo place text close to the progress bar.\nDo not place text far away from the progress bar.\nInternationalization (RTL)\nFor RTL (right-to-left) languages, the layout of the progress bar is mirrored\nfor both determinate and indeterminate options. The label is right-aligned, the\nvalue is left-aligned, and the fill progresses from right to left. Keep in mind\nthat the placement of the percent sign differs depending on the locale.\nPlay\nContent\nDeterminate and indeterminate progress bars both have a label and an optional\nhelper text. However, the indeterminate can\u2019t provide the exact, quantitative\ninformation about the progression in the optional helper text.\nLabels\nLabels inform users what information the progress bar is processing.\nKeep the label short and concise by limiting it to a few words or a single\nline of text.\nLabel text should never change as the progress bar is loading. It also does\nnot need to be updated when the process ends, since the success or error\ninformation is provided by the bar indicator color and an icon, along with any\nhelper text.\nHelper text\nHelper text is used to show additional information about the process taking\nplace.\nCommon use cases of helper text for a progress bar can either be a generic\nphrase, for example \u201cFetching assets\u2026\u201d, or it can indicate an exact amount of\nsomething to be completed, for example \u201c42/256 items\u201d.\nWhen indicating a loading percentage, the percentage number should count up as\nthe bar progresses.\nFurther guidance\nFor further content guidance, see Carbon\u2019s\ncontent guidelines\n.\nUniversal behaviors\nStatuses\nThere are three statuses for the progress bar: active, success, and error. These\nstatuses also apply on both indeterminate and determinate progress bars. After\nthe process completes successfully or unsuccessfully, a progress bar can either\nremain persistent as confirmation or validation, or it can be automatically\ndismissed depending on what is most suitable for the use case.\nActive\nThe active status, represented by an animated blue bar indicator, conveys that\nthe action is still in progress.\nSuccess\nThe success status, conveyed by a full-width green progress bar and checkmark\nicon, indicates that the action completed successfully.\nError\nThe error status indicates that the action did not successfully complete. If an\nerror occurs, an inline notification or error handling within the form should\nappear. As soon as a process fails, the indicator bar\u2019s progress spans full\nwidth, turns red, and remains visible. A failed icon is also shown.\nPlay\nThe example shows the progress bar with error remains persistent as\nconfirmation inside the image tile.\nPlay\nThe example shows the progress bar is automatically dismissed once it\u2019s done\nuploading.\nInteractions\nPart of a page\nWhile the progress bar is processing information on part of a page, you can\nstill interact with other elements on the page. When the progress bar finishes\nprocessing it can either remain persistent on the page for confirmation or\nautomatically dismiss itself depending on the use case.\nThe example shows the progress bar is active and separated from other\ninteractive elements.\nInside a container\nWhile the progress bar is processing information that could affect multiple\npieces of content within a container, such as a card, depending on the use case,\nthe whole container should become inactive until processing has been completed\nor the specific section within the container being processed should become\ninactive until processing has been completed. The user should be able to\ninteract with the rest of the container or page that is unaffected by the\nprogress bar.\nThe example shows the \u2018View task\u2019 action button is disabled inside the \u2018Tasks\u2019\ncontainer while the progress bar is active.\nModifiers\nTransitions\nAn indeterminate bar can change to a determinate indicator (finishing from left\nto right) when enough information is gathered to end the load animation.\nPlay\nAccessibility\nThe loading component is implemented using the ARIA 1.1 progressbar pattern.\nFor determinate progress bar, it outputs an ARIA\nrole=\"progressbar\"\nCopy to clipboard\nand uses\naria-valuemin\nCopy to clipboard\n,\naria-valuemax\nCopy to clipboard\n, and\naria-valuenow\nCopy to clipboard\nto convey the loaded\npercentage to screen reader users.\nIf the progress bar shows the loading of a specific part or region of the\napplication, set\naria-busy=\"true\"\nCopy to clipboard\nand\naria-describedby=\"[progressbar-id]\"\nCopy to clipboard\non the related element to ensure assistive technologies can correctly convey\nthis relation to the user.\nOnly hide the label when it is absolute clear to the user which process the\nprogress bar represents. Note that you are still required to pass an\nappropriate label which will be read by screen readers.\nRelated\nComponents\nLoading\nInline loading\nProgress indicator\nPattern\nLoading: skeleton states\nReferences\nAccessible Rich Internet Applications Working Group,\n\u201cprogressbar\u201d role\n,\n(W3C, 2017)\nKatie Sherwin,\nProgress Indicators Make a Slow System Less Insufferable\n(Nielsen Norman Group, 2001)\nJakob Nielsen,\nResponse Times: The 3 Important Limits (Nielsen Norman Group\n,\n(Nielsen Norman Group, 1993)\nFeedback\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\nGitHub\n.\nEdit this page on GitHub\nPrevious\nComponents: Popover\nNext\nProgress bar: Style",

Keep in mind\nthat the placement of the percent sign differs depending on the locale.\n\nPlay\n\n[![](data:image/png;base64,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)](/static/progress-bar-usage-11-0001d7509ff1e05be09620972f5e0fa6.mp4)\n\n## Content\n\nDeterminate and indeterminate progress bars both have a label and an optional\nhelper text. However, the indeterminate can\u2019t provide the exact, quantitative\ninformation about the progression in the optional helper text.\n\n#### Labels\n\n- Labels inform users what information the progress bar is processing.\n- Keep the label short and concise by limiting it to a few words or a single\n  line of text.\n- Label text should never change as the progress bar is loading. It also does\n  not need to be updated when the process ends, since the success or error\n  information is provided by the bar indicator color and an icon, along with any\n  helper text.\n\n#### Helper text\n\n- Helper text is used to show additional information about the process taking\n  place.\n- Common use cases of helper text for a progress bar can either be a generic\n  phrase, for example \u201cFetching assets\u2026\u201d, or it can indicate an exact amount of\n  something to be completed, for example \u201c42/256 items\u201d.\n- When indicating a loading percentage, the percentage number should count up as\n  the bar progresses.\n\n### Further guidance\n\nFor further content guidance, see Carbon\u2019s\n[content guidelines](%5Bhttps://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/overview/%5D).\n\n## Universal behaviors\n\n### Statuses\n\nThere are three statuses for the progress bar: active, success, and error. These\nstatuses also apply on both indeterminate and determinate progress bars. After\nthe process completes successfully or unsuccessfully, a progress bar can either\nremain persistent as confirmation or validation, or it can be automatically\ndismissed depending on what is most suitable for the use case.\n\n![Progress bar states](/static/5affeac033a67a8463cecbb6330dc7ff/3cbba/progress-bar-usage-16.png)\n\n#### Active\n\nThe active status, represented by an animated blue bar indicator, conveys that\nthe action is still in progress.\n\n#### Success\n\nThe success status, conveyed by a full-width green progress bar and checkmark\nicon, indicates that the action completed successfully.\n\n#### Error\n\nThe error status indicates that the action did not successfully complete. If an\nerror occurs, an inline notification or error handling within the form should\nappear. As soon as a process fails, the indicator bar\u2019s progress spans full\nwidth, turns red, and remains visible. A failed icon is also shown.\n\nPlay\n\n[![](/static/progress-bar-usage-17-93fea04b18e76524dcc01e4ab7ac05c3.png)](/static/progress-bar-usage-17-2a519a042ff38a3faa0edd09e7a89401.mp4)\n\nThe example shows the progress bar with error remains persistent as\nconfirmation inside the image tile.\n\nPlay\n\n[![](/static/progress-bar-usage-18-f2afa2f6c5ea78c4d8e4c9c1ae3000ab.png)](/static/progress-bar-usage-18-7b7c5d22864620800408b26597e52122.mp4)\n\nThe example shows the progress bar is automatically dismissed once it\u2019s done\nuploading.\n\n### Interactions\n\n#### Part of a page\n\nWhile the progress bar is processing information on part of a page, you can\nstill interact with other elements on the page. When the progress bar finishes\nprocessing it can either remain persistent on the page for confirmation or\nautomatically dismiss itself depending on the use case.\n\n![Progress bar as a part of a page](/static/1bba2957d1701cd9c639aee8dfca5550/3cbba/progress-bar-usage-19.png)\n\nThe example shows the progress bar is active and separated from other\ninteractive elements.\n\n#### Inside a container\n\nWhile the progress bar is processing information that could affect multiple\npieces of content within a container, such as a card, depending on the use case,\nthe whole container should become inactive until processing has been completed\nor the specific section within the container being processed should become\ninactive until processing has been completed. The user should be able to\ninteract with the rest of the container or page that is unaffected by the\nprogress bar.\n\n![Progress bar inside a container](/static/6481cb44f3fcca930b48d5c43d2eb655/3cbba/progress-bar-usage-20.png)\n\nThe example shows the \u2018View task\u2019 action button is disabled inside the \u2018Tasks\u2019\ncontainer while the progress bar is active.\n\n## Modifiers\n\n#### Transitions\n\nAn indeterminate bar can change to a determinate indicator (finishing from left\nto right) when enough information is gathered to end the load animation.\n\nPlay\n\n[![](/static/progress-bar-usage-21-bd96147fdb9f842ef7e51f755353fca3.png)](/static/progress-bar-usage-21-e0fa2888cad6b0d34015d35107586740.mp4)\n\n## Accessibility\n\n- The loading component is implemented using the ARIA 1.1 progressbar pattern.\n  For determinate progress bar, it outputs an ARIA\n\n  ```\n  role=\"progressbar\"\n  ```\n\n  Copy to clipboard\n\n  and uses\n\n  ```\n  aria-valuemin\n  ```\n\n  Copy to clipboard\n\n  ,\n\n  ```\n  aria-valuemax\n  ```\n\n  Copy to clipboard\n\n  , and\n\n  ```\n  aria-valuenow\n  ```\n\n  Copy to clipboard\n\n  to convey the loaded\n  percentage to screen reader users.\n- If the progress bar shows the loading of a specific part or region of the\n  application, set\n\n  ```\n  aria-busy=\"true\"\n  ```\n\n  Copy to clipboard\n\n  and\n\n  ```\n  aria-describedby=\"[progressbar-id]\"\n  ```\n\n  Copy to clipboard\n\n  on the related element to ensure assistive technologies can correctly convey\n  this relation to the user.\n- Only hide the label when it is absolute clear to the user which process the\n  progress bar represents. Note that you are still required to pass an\n  appropriate label which will be read by screen readers.\n\n## Related\n\n#### Components\n\n- [Loading](/components/loading/usage)\n- [Inline loading](/components/inline-loading/usage)\n- [Progress indicator](/components/progress-indicator/usage)\n\n#### Pattern\n\n- [Loading: skeleton states](https://carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/loading-pattern/#skeleton-states)\n\n## References\n\n- Accessible Rich Internet Applications Working Group,\n  [\u201cprogressbar\u201d role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_progressbar_role),\n  (W3C, 2017)\n- Katie Sherwin,\n  [Progress Indicators Make a Slow System Less Insufferable](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progress-indicators/)\n  (Nielsen Norman Group, 2001)\n- Jakob Nielsen,\n  [Response Times: The 3 Important Limits (Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/),\n  (Nielsen Norman Group, 1993)\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n\n[Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/edit/main/src/pages/components/progress-bar/usage.mdx)\n\n[Previous\n\nComponents: Popover](/components/popover/usage/)\n\n[Next\n\nProgress bar: Style](/components/progress-bar/style/)",
