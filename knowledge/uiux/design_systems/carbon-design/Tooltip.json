They provide additional information\nwhen a user hovers over or focuses on a UI element and should only be used when\nnecessary to offer quick context without cluttering the interface.\nWhen to use\nBy default, most components such as icon buttons, icon tabs, sliders, and copy\nbuttons already have built-in tooltips, so there\u2019s no need to add one\nseparately. Customization is allowed but not recommended.\nTooltips can be used to:\nShow names of controls, like icon buttons, that lack visual labels\nProvide additional information for focusable elements, helping users make\ninformed decisions\nOffer more context or explanation for specific elements\nDefine a term or provide details for an inline item (definition tooltip)\nDefinition tooltip\nA definition tooltip is used to define terms or give extra help within text. It\nworks well on UI labels, words in paragraphs, or compact spaces like data\ntables, where extra icons might clutter the interface.\nWhen not to use\nProvide critical information\nSince a tooltip disappears when a user hovers away, do not include pertinent\ninformation for the user to complete their task. Use helper text that is always\nvisible and accessible for vital information, such as required fields.\nInclude interactive elements\nDo not include interactive elements within a tooltip. Interactive elements in\ntooltips are inaccessible for some users and are hard to use for all users since\ntooltips do not receive focus. If images, buttons, or links need to be included\nin supplemental information, use the\ntoggletip\ncomponent and the disclosure pattern that allows for better tabbing and focus\nstructure, improving the experience for all users.\nDo use helper text for pertinent information.\nDo not use tooltips for information for a user to complete their task.\nUse succinct, directive text.\nDo not use interactive elements within a tooltip.\nTooltips versus toggletips\nTooltips and toggletips look visually similar, and both have an interactive\ntrigger. The two components differ of how they are invoked and dismissed and if\nthe user is required to interact with the contents. A tooltip is exposed on\nhover or focus when you need to disclose brief, supplemental information that is\nnot interactive. A toggletip is used on click or enter when you must expose\ninteractive elements, such as a button, that a user needs to interact with.\nExample of a tooltip versus a toggletip\nFormatting\nAnatomy\nUI trigger:\nUI trigger includes any component with integrated tooltips or\ndefinition terms with dotted underlines\nCaret tip:\nClosely associates the container with the related trigger\nelement\nContainer:\nContains short or brief text\nAlignment\nThe container of the tooltip may be aligned to\nstart\n,\ncenter\nor\nend\nto keep the container from bleeding off the page or covering important\ninformation. The UI trigger button and caret tip should be vertically centered\nwith each other to associate the tooltip and the trigger. This is especially\nhelpful when multiple elements are close to each other.\nTooltip containers can be automatically or manually positioned to the start,\ncenter, or end\nPlacement\nTooltip directions, by default, are set to auto. Upon opening, tooltips can\ndetect the edges of the browser to be placed in view so the container does not\nget cutoff. Tooltips can instead use specific directions and may be\npositioned\nright\n,\nleft\n,\nbottom\n,\u00a0or\ntop\nof the trigger item.

The tooltip\npersists if the mouse remains over the active container or the UI trigger. The\ntooltip is dismissed by hovering away to another element.\nDefinition tooltips can use either hover or click interactions, depending on the\nsituation. Users can hover if they need a quick glance at the information.
