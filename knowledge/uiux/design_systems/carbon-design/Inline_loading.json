These different statuses report the work that Carbon has done in the back end. These tests appear only when the components are stable.\n\n[##### Default state\n\nTested](//accessibility/#accessibility-testing-status)\n\n[##### Advanced states\n\nNot tested](//accessibility/#accessibility-testing-status)\n\n[##### Screen reader\n\nManually tested](//accessibility/#accessibility-testing-status)\n\n[##### Keyboard navigation\n\nNot available](//accessibility/#accessibility-testing-status)\n\n## Overview\n\nInline loading spinners are used to indicate that an action is being processed.\nThey inform users that their request is in progress, providing reassurance even\nthough they do not reveal specific details about the back-end process.\n\nCommon actions where inline loading is beneficial include create, update, or\ndelete operations that involve significant data processing. Inline loading can\nappear in various contexts, such as within a table, after clicking a primary or\nsecondary button, or inside a modal.\n\n### When to use\n\n- Use an inline loading component for any action that cannot be performed\n  instantly and will only require a short time to process.\n- Use when retrieving or refreshing small data amounts, such as status.\n\n### When not to use\n\n- Don\u2019t use inline loading for full page loads, use skeleton states instead.\n- Don\u2019t trigger inline loading on more than one item or action at a time, unless\n  on initial page load or refresh.\n\n## Formatting\n\n### Anatomy\n\n![Example of inline loading](/static/07fdcb590492a036c99642e01a2b2667/3cbba/inline-loading-anatomy.png)\n\n1. **Loading status**: indicates the state of the loading sequence (active,\n   inactive, finished, error).\n2. **Label (optional)**: assistive text that explains the loading status.\n\n### Placement\n\nWhen inline loading temporarily replaces content, it should appear in the same\nspot as the content it replaced and maintain the same alignment.\n\n![Example of inline loading placement](/static/7f3fac44b52a4ce6aaeebd65056ca375/3cbba/inline-loading-alignment.png)\n\n## Content\n\n### Main elements\n\n#### Label (optional)\n\n- Descriptive loading text for the action is optional, but encouraged. If you\n  have limited room or find adding text to be unnecessary you can just run\n  through the animations.\n- The label should describe the state of the action being performed.
