These tags are typically used for filtering and creating user-generated content.\nSelectable tag\nTags that can be selected or deselected and are frequently used as selections that filter data in the context of a page. They also can be used in chat flows to make decisions to advance the chat.\nOperational tag\nWhen interacted with, these tags can disclose additional or overflow tags, like in a popover, modal, or breadcrumb detail view.\nFormatting\nAnatomy\nRead-only, dismissible, selectable, and operational tags are all comprised of a\ncontainer, a text title, and the option to add a decorative icon. Dismissible\ntags include an additional close icon to filter or dismiss a tag.

This is commonly referred to as the default or normal state of the component.\nHover\nWhen a user is hovering over the tag with the mouse cursor to interact with it (except read-only tags).\nFocus\nWhen a user presses tab or clicks on the tag, it becomes focused, indicating the user has successfully navigated to the component (except read-only tags).\nOn click\nWhen a user presses enters, space, or clicks on the tag to either dismiss it or disclose a list of additional tags.\nSelected\nWhen a user presses enter, space, or clicks on the tag to select it or deselect it.\nDisabled\nWhen a user is not allowed to interact with the tag due to either permissions, dependencies, or pre-requisites. The disabled state completely removes the interactive function from a component. The styling is not subject to WCAG contrast compliance.\nInteractions\nMouse\nRead-only tags: Do not get mouse functionality besides a mouse cursor on hover\nand do not have interactive functionality.\nDismissible tags: Receive a mouse cursor when hovering over the title area of\nthe tag. When hovering over the close icon, the icon gets a background color\nchange and a mouse pointer. Once the close icon area is clicked, the tag will be\ndismissed, closed, or removed.\nSelectable tags: Receive a full background color change and mouse pointer on\nhover. Clicking anywhere on the tag will put it in a selected state. Once in the\nselected state, clicking anywhere on the tag again will deselect it.\nOperational tags: Receive a background color change and mouse pointer on hover.\nClicking anywhere on the tag will disclose a way of viewing more related tags in\neither a popover, modal, or breadcrumb view.\nKeyboard\nRead-only tags: Can not be operated by a keyboard and have no interactive\nfunctionality.\nDismissible tags: Receive focus on the close icon area by pressing the\nTab\nCopy to clipboard\nkey. Pressing the\nEnter\nCopy to clipboard\nor\nSpace\nCopy to clipboard\nkeys will dismiss, close, or remove the\ntag.\nSelectable tags: The container receives focus by pressing the\nTab\nCopy to clipboard\nkey.\nPressing the\nEnter\nCopy to clipboard\nor\nSpace\nCopy to clipboard\nkeys will select or deselect the tag. If\nnavigating in a group of tags, use the\nTab\nCopy to clipboard\nkey to move focus to different tags\nin the group.\nOperational tags: The container receives focus by pressing the\nTab\nCopy to clipboard\nkey.\nPressing the\nEnter\nCopy to clipboard\nor\nSpace\nCopy to clipboard\nkeys will disclose additional related tags, in a\npopover, modal, or breadcrumb view.\nClickable areas\nRead-only tags are not clickable and can not be interacted with. Dismissible\ntags have a clickable area around the close icon to dismiss or close the tag.\nSelectable and operational tags containers are clickable to either select the\ntag or view more tags.\nRead-only, dismissible, selectable, and operational tags with their clickable\nareas.\nRead-only tag\nRead-only tags are used to categorize, are used for labeling, and do not have\ninteractive functionality. Read-only tags come in several color choices and can\nuse optional decorative icons to delineate between multiple categories.\nRead-only tags in the context of a product UI.\nIf your design intends to use tags as labels or for categorization, use\nmodifiers like colors or icons to help indicate this differentiation.\nDo use colors to help distinguish between different tag labels or categories for easier scanning.\nDo not use the same color for every tag if they are supposed to be used as labels or categories.\nDismissible tag\nDismissible tags allow users to dismiss, close, or remove a tag. Dismissible\ntags are commonly used with the search component to search or filter keywords on\na page or within sections of a page.\nDismissible tags can also be used as user-generated labels that are applied to\ninstances and can be removed later if needed. Do not use a dismissible tag if\nthe intention for it is to remain persistent at all times since they can be\nclosed or dismissed by the user.\nDismissible tags in the context of a product UI.\nSelectable tag\nSelectable tags give users the ability to select or deselect them. They can be\nused in a form containing only tags as the selection method, in a chat to make\ndecisions and forward the chat, and can be used as selections to filter content\non a page or within a component.\nIn some cases, selectable tags can be an alternative to traditional form\ncomponents when the entire form consistently uses tags as its form selection\nstyle. Selectable tags can be used for multi-selection or single-selection use\ncases. These tags should always remain in high contrast to ensure a noticeable\ndifference between selected and unselected tags.\nSelectable tags in the context of a product UI.\nWhen selectable tags are in groups, we recommend using horizontal alignment for\neasier scanning when there are only a few tags. Keep groups of tags horizontally\non one line when there are six tags or less. Horizontal alignment is not\nrecommended when there are many tags to select from in a group. Tags should wrap\nto form another line if there are too many to arrange horizontally on one line.\nIf the number of tags exceeds five lines of wrapping, consider using a different\ncomponent for your use case, like a\nmulti-select dropdown\n.\nDo wrap tags in a group to a few multiple lines.\nDo not wrap tags in a group of more than five lines.\nOperational tag\nOperational tags enable the user to see a more comprehensive view of all tags\ndisclosed in a popover, or breadcrumb detail view. Do not use tags as links that\ndirect you to an entirely different page or launch you from a current experience\nto a separate tab.\nOperational tags in the context of a product UI.\nModifiers\nDecorative icons\nDecorative icons lead before the tag title. Decorative icons are optional and\nare often used to support the tag title visually. We recommend not using\ndecorative icons in the small tag size where there is compact spacing, which\ncould create possible visual tension between some icon shapes and tags with\nborders.\nTags with decorative icons.\nTag colors\nRead-only, dismissible, and operational tags come in a variety of different\ncolors, with values from the IBM Design Language\ncolor palette\nusing\ncomponent tokens\n. It is\nrecommended to use multiple colors to denote different categories or labels.\nSelectable tags are unavailable in these colors; instead, they use\ncore tokens\n.\nRead-only using component color tokens and selectable tags using core color\ntokens.\nAI presence\nTag has a modification that embeds the AI label when AI is present in the\ncomponent. The AI variants function the same as the normal versions except with\nthe addition of the inline AI label which is both a visual indicator and the\ntrigger for the explainability popover. Read-only and dismissible tags are the\nonly tag variants that allow for the interactive AI label.\nFor more information on designing for AI, see the\nCarbon for AI\nguidelines.\nRead-only AI tag (top), dismissible tag (bottom)\nFeedback\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\nGitHub\n.\nEdit this page on GitHub\nPrevious\nComponents: Tabs\nNext\nTag: Style",

Decorative icons are optional and\nare often used to support the tag title visually. We recommend not using\ndecorative icons in the small tag size where there is compact spacing, which\ncould create possible visual tension between some icon shapes and tags with\nborders.\n\n![Tags with decorative icons.](/static/79f5abe17a3446b6407a84adafa3edb2/3cbba/tag-usage-decorative-icons.png)\n\nTags with decorative icons.\n\n### Tag colors\n\nRead-only, dismissible, and operational tags come in a variety of different\ncolors, with values from the IBM Design Language\n[color palette](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/color) using\n[component tokens](https://carbondesignsystem.com/elements/color/tokens). It is\nrecommended to use multiple colors to denote different categories or labels.\nSelectable tags are unavailable in these colors; instead, they use\n[core tokens](https://carbondesignsystem.com/elements/color/overview#core-tokens).\n\n![Read-only using component color tokens and selectable tags using core color tokens.](/static/41e9d386a16e50074390fa9010c9897c/3cbba/tag-usage-colors.png)\n\nRead-only using component color tokens and selectable tags using core color\ntokens.\n\n## AI presence\n\nTag has a modification that embeds the AI label when AI is present in the\ncomponent. The AI variants function the same as the normal versions except with\nthe addition of the inline AI label which is both a visual indicator and the\ntrigger for the explainability popover. Read-only and dismissible tags are the\nonly tag variants that allow for the interactive AI label.\n\nFor more information on designing for AI, see the\n[Carbon for AI](/guidelines/carbon-for-ai/) guidelines.\n\n![Example of AI labels in tags.](/static/b148db125f84c7568cbe8e44a715ea06/3cbba/tag-usage-ai-presence.png)\n\nRead-only AI tag (top), dismissible tag (bottom)\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n\n[Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/edit/main/src/pages/components/tag/usage.mdx)\n\n[Previous\n\nComponents: Tabs](/components/tabs/usage/)\n\n[Next\n\nTag: Style](/components/tag/style/)",
