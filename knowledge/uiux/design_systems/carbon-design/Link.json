They provide a lightweight option for navigation, but like other\ninteractive elements, too many links will clutter a page and make it difficult\nfor users to identify their next steps. This is especially true for inline\nlinks, which should be used sparingly.\nWhen to use\nUse links when you want users to:\nNavigate to a different page within the application\nNavigate to an entirely different site\nJump to an element on the same page\nLink to emails or phone numbers\nWhen not to use\nDo not use links for actions that will change data or manipulate how it is\ndisplayed, change a state, or trigger an action. Instead, use\nbuttons\nto guide\nusers to specific actions.\nDo not use images as links. Instead, use a\ntile\nthat can contain\nan image and additional information such as links.\nVariants\nVariant\nUsage\nStandalone\nUsed on their own or directly following content and do not use underlines.

It\u2019s common to use the\n\u201claunch\u201d icon for external links and the \u201carrow right\u201d icon for internal links.\nWhatever icons you choose to use, ensure that the same icons are used\nconsistently for navigating to or launching new pages.\nFurther guidance\nFor further content guidance, see Carbon\u2019s\nContent guidelines\n.\nUniversal behaviors\nStates\nList has six main states \u2013 enabled (unvisited), hover, focus, active, visited,\nand disabled. Learn more about states on the\nStyle\ntab.\nState\nWhen to use\nEnabled (unvisited)\nThis is the default state of a link. When the user has not clicked on a link yet.\nHover\nWhen the user hovers the cursor over a link.\nFocus\nWhen the user\u00a0tabs\u00a0to or clicks on the link, it becomes focused, indicating the user has successfully navigated to the component.\nActive\nWhen the user is clicking on a link.\nVisited\nWhen the user has previously clicked on unvisited links. There\u2019s a change in the color token as\n$link-visited\nCopy to clipboard\n.\nDisabled\nWhen a user cannot interact with the link. Links could be temporarily inactive or unavailable.\nInteractions\nMouse\nUsers can open a link by clicking anywhere on the link text or on the associated\nicon.\nKeyboard\nUsers can open a link by pressing\nEnter\nCopy to clipboard\nwhile the link has focus. For\nadditional keyboard interactions, see the\nAccessibility\ntab.\nResponsive behavior\nClicking or activating on a link can:\nOpen up a modal with read-only information\nNavigate the user to a new page, changing the URL and causing a browser\nrefresh\nSupport jumps to different sections within the same page\nOpen web resources such as images, videos, or HTML documents\nClickable areas\nBoth standalone and inline links are clickable across the entire width of the\ntext. Standalone link with an icon has an expanded clickable area that includes\nthe icon.\nStandalone and inline links with their clickable areas\nStandalone link\nStandalone links are used on their own directly following content. They should\nnot be used within sentences or paragraphs. Standalone links are the default\nlink style for Carbon and only have an underline in the hover state, focus\nstate, and active state.\nThe standalone link component can be paired with an icon. Icons should always be\nthe same color as the link text. When necessary, utilize appropriate icons to\ndistinguish them from ghost buttons or inline links when they appear within the\nsame context or page.\nExample shows the standalone link within context\nInline link\nInline links are used in sentences or paragraphs of text. The inline link\nbehaves the same as the standalone link but it is styled with an underline. This\nhelps differentiate them from the text they are placed next to and makes it\nclear users can interact with them.\nInline links should not be used on their own and should not be paired with\nicons.\nExample shows inline links within the body text\nModifiers\nVisited style\nBy default, the link component does not use a visited style. Visited links\nindicate that a user has already opened the link so they can be a helpful\nindicator during task completion. Visited styles should be used sparingly\nbecause they often clutter the page and add further visual noise as users are\ntrying to navigate a product. They can be used to show users they have already\nclicked on a link if it\u2019s important.\nExample shows unvisited and visited links\nLinks that trigger actions\nSome links trigger actions to aid task completion in addition to navigation.\nThese links should still serve a navigation purpose. A common example is linking\nphone numbers, so clicking the website automatically opens and calls the phone\nnumber when clicked. The link text and any accompanying icons should clarify\nwhat action will be triggered and where the user will be directed.\nExample shows inline links for email\nDo use links when actions navigate users to resources\nDo not use buttons when actions serve as a navigation purpose\nLink grouping\nCode unavailability\nThe following specs are not developed for the link\ncomponent but are recommended by design as the proper distance between grouped\nlinks. View the\nStyle\ntab for details.\nLinks can be grouped horizontally or vertically. One variation displays links in\na horizontal row with an icon and is typically used within the main body of the\npage. Vertical links are typically used for resource links on the side of the\nmain page content or additional links in tiles.\nExample shows horizontal and vertical grouping of links\nRelated\nButton\nButtons are used to initialize an action. Button labels express what action will\noccur when the user interacts with it. For further guidance, see Carbon\u2019s\nbutton\n.\nTile\nTiles are a highly flexible component for displaying a wide variety of content,\nincluding information, getting started, how-to, next steps, and more.
