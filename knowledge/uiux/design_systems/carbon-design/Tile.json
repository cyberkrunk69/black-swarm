Tile is often laid out in groups, is a different\ncolor than the UI background, and responds to the grid. Tiles have no pre-set\nstyles and are purposely flexible so product teams can determine their tile\ncontent for specific use cases.\nExample of the tile component in a UI\nTiles versus cards\nTiles are simple and foundational. Cards can be very complex. Cards are built\nupon the tile foundation and have various patterns of information hierarchy,\nmultiple actions, overflow menus, selectable features, etc. Carbon does not have\na card pattern, but we link out to several card patterns within our pattern\nasset library (PAL) ecosystem below:\nProductive versus Expressive cards\n(Carbon for IBM Products)\nDashboard cards\n(IBM Sustainability Software Design)\nCards\n(Carbon for\nIBM.com)\nWhen to use\nTiles are reusable components that provide shortcuts to building cards and other\nmodules. Use tiles to group related information in flexible containers. Here are\nsome common use cases for when to use tiles:\nTo contain related groupings of information or actions\nTo guide users to take actions or navigate\nTo present options for single or multiple selections\nTo hide or show large amounts of content\nWhen not to use\nTiles reside on the same plane as the page background layer and do not have\nelevation. Tiles organize essential information and have the same visual\nhierarchy as content on the same page.\nDo not add a drop shadow to tiles and use them to reveal secondary information,\nactions, or notifications. Use\nmodals\n,\npopovers\n, and\ndialogs\nthat have\nelevation and are appropriate for this use case instead.\nVariants\nTiles can have different functions and are implemented in four ways: base,\nclickable, selectable, and expandable. These tile variants are flexible to\nsupport various use cases when building more complicated card features.\nVariant\nPurpose\nBase\nFor high-level, short, and digestible content pieces such as features, plans, or services offered.\nClickable\nFor prompting an action, navigating or directing to other pieces of information about the subject matter. This variant has an available feature flag.\nSelectable\nFor presenting options to a user in a structured manner, such as a set of pricing plans. This variant has available feature flags.\nExpandable\nFor hiding and revealing a large amount of content to focus on specific pieces of information. This variant has an available feature flag.\nFeature flags\nFeature flags\nhave been added to the\nclickable, selectable, and expandable variants of tile to improve accessibility\nand changes its visual appearance, not its functionality. For code-specific\nfeature flag information, refer to the\nCode\ntab. These\ncurrent variants of tile are not being deprecated, but teams are encouraged to\nuse the feature flag tile for their products moving forward. Once the next major\nrelease (v12) is released in the future, these feature flags will become the\ndefault version of the component.\nThe following are the feature flag changes made to tile.\nA border has been added to the clickable, selectable, and expandable variants\nof tile to visually indicate they are operable.\nSingle-select tile icons have been changed from checkmark icons to radio\nbutton icons, where as multi-select tile icons have been changed from\ncheckmark icons to checkbox icons. These icons appear in the enabled state\ninstead of only on hover before making a selection.\nFlag enabled\nFlag disabled\nFormatting\nSizing\nTile width varies depending on the three basic gutter modes:\nwide\n,\nnarrow\n, and\ncondensed\n. Tile height varies depending on the content\nplaced within it while using\nspacing tokens\nand\nfollowing\naspect ratios\n.\nThe minimum tile height is a 2:1 aspect ratio. As the content grows, set\nvertical spacing between sections within the content area.\nAlignment\nTile groups\nTile groups are helpful when aligning tiles that have a strong relationship.\nTile groups usually flow horizontally from left to right and have hierarchical\nimportance, similar to navigation or catalog tiles.\nExample image of tiles on the wide grid\nExample image of tiles on the narrow grid\nExample image of tiles on the condensed grid\nDo match the tile variants in groups.\nDo not mix different variants of tiles in groups.\nLayout\nThere are three basic layouts for tiles:\nstandard\n,\nvertical masonry\n, and\nhorizontal masonry\n. The standard layout is the the most commonly used.\nIn a standard layout, tiles are the same in height and width as all other\ntiles in the group.\nIn a vertical masonry layout, tiles can vary in height, but are consistent in\nwidth.\nIn a horizontal masonry layout, tiles can vary in width; different rows of\ntiles may vary in height, but tiles within a row should be consistent in\nheight.\nExamples of standard, vertical masonry, and horizontal masonry tile layouts\nContent\nMain elements\nTile text\nTile text can vary based on the content. It can consist of heading text, body\ntext, label text, and include interactive elements.\nFurther guidance\nFor further content guidance, see\nCarbon\u2019s\ncontent guidelines\n.\nBase\nBase tiles are used to display information to the user, such as features or\nservices offered. Base tiles are often seen on marketing pages to promote\ncontent or on highly interactive dashboards. These tiles can have internal\ncalls-to-action (CTAs), such as a\nbuttons\nor\nlinks\n.\nExample of base tiles\nAnatomy\nAnatomy of base tiles\nContainer\n: Contains all content in a tile.\nText\n: The text in a tile.\nInteractive elements (optional)\n: Elements like links or buttons in a tile\nthat are interactive.\nAlignment\nWhen placing interactive elements within base tiles, place links at the bottom\nleft of the tile and span buttons in width at the bottom to indicate\ncall-to-action items.\nDo left align the link at the bottom of the base tile.\nDo span the button in width at the bottom of the base tile.\nStates\nBase tiles only have an\nenabled\nstate because they are not operable by a\nmouse or keyboard.

The AI variants function the same as the normal\nversions except with the addition of the AI label which is both a visual\nindicator and the trigger for the explainability popover.\n\nFor more information on designing for AI, see the\n[Carbon for AI](/guidelines/carbon-for-ai/) guidelines.\n\n![Base, clickable, and selectable tiles with AI presence and feature flags enabled](/static/dd6721e604f28a5d87251025e0b88611/3cbba/tile-usage-AI-presence.png)\n\nBase, clickable, and selectable tiles with AI presence and feature flags\nenabled\n\n## Related\n\n#### Grid\n\nTo learn more about how to build tiles correctly on the grid, see Carbon\u2019s\n[2x grid](/elements/2x-grid/implementation).\n\n#### Aspect ratio\n\nThe aspect ratio is important when building tiles and images. For further\nguidance, see Carbon\u2019s\n[aspect ratio](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/elements/2x-grid/overview/#aspect-ratio)\nand its\n[implementation](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/elements/2x-grid/implementation#screen-regions).\n\n#### Buttons\n\nWhen in doubt, use full-span button alignment within tiles. For further\nguidance, see Carbon\u2019s\n[buttons](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/).\n\n#### Link\n\nLink has variants depending on the context. For further guidance, see Carbon\u2019s\n[link](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/link/usage/).\n\n#### Spacing\n\nSpacing helps deliver clear and functional layouts. For further guidance, see\nCarbon\u2019s [spacing](https://carbondesignsystem.com/elements/spacing/overview/).\n\n## References\n\nHagan Rivers,\n[Interactions design with cards/tiles](https://medium.com/@hagan.rivers/interaction-design-with-cards-tiles-5a6895aa220d/)\n(Medium, 2017)\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n\n[Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/edit/main/src/pages/components/tile/usage.mdx)\n\n[Previous\n\nComponents: Text input](/components/text-input/usage/)\n\n[Next\n\nTile: Style](/components/tile/style/)",
