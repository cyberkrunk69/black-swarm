They are also often used to narrow\nlarge content groups or to sort related content. For example, a messaging tool\nmay use a content switcher to divide messages into three views such as \u201cAll,\u201d\n\u201cRead,\u201d and \u201cUnread.\u201d\nWhen not to use\nDistinct content areas\nWhen navigating between distinct content areas like subpages, use\ntabs\ninstead of a content switcher. Tabs follow the\nmetaphor for sections in a filing cabinet, and two tabs wouldn\u2019t contain the\nsame sheet of paper, so the role of tabs in the information hierarchy is to\nseparate content.\nContent switcher is often used with tabs but at a lower hierarchy to sort\nrelated contents within that tab content.\nBinary actions\nFor binary actions or choices, such as \u201cyes/no\u201d or \u201con/off\u201d use a\ntoggle\ninstead of a content switcher. A content\nswitcher can be used for binary views, like switching between a grid and list\nview but should not be used as a binary input control.\nFormatting\nAnatomy\nAnatomy of a content switcher\nSelected content tab:\nOnly one content tab can be selected at a time and\nthere should always be one selected.\nContent tab:\nSelectable container for each content view.\nLabel text:\nText or icon that describes the content view.\nContent view:\nAn area that can consist of component(s) and is usually\nright below the content switcher. Its view changes based on the selection.\nSizing\nHeight\nThere are three height sizes for the content switcher\u2014small (32px), medium\n(40px), and large (48px). Choose a size that best fits your layout\u2019s density or\nthe switcher\u2019s prominence.\nDefault\nIcon\nText width\nEach content tab in the group should be the same width. The content tab with the\nlongest label text should have at minimum 16px spacing to the right of the\nlabel.\nDo base content tab width on the longest label text.\nDo not use a different width for each content tab.\nIcon width\nEach content tab in the group should be the same fixed width. Do not stretch the\ncontent tab container to different proportions.\nDo keep a fixed width container so the height always equals the width.\nDo not use different container sizes or extend the container width so it does not equal the height.\nAlignment\nA content switcher can align to a grid column or hang in the gutter to create\ntype alignment. Use layout and hierarchy cues to determine which alignment is\nbest. In contained space, the content switcher should never be flush to an edge\nand instead left-align with other content in the container.\nDo vertically align switchers with other page content.\nDo not flush align the switcher to the edges of containers.\nAligning to the content\nFor content-driven widths, the content tab with the longest label text should\nhave 16px spacing to the right of the label, and then the widths of all other\ntabs should match that widest tab.\nExample shows the content-driven switcher\u2019s text does not align with the grid.\nAligning to the grid\nFor grid-aware width, the content switcher spans a set of columns, with each tab\nbeing equal in size. Depending on placement, the first tab or the tab\u2019s label\nshould align with the first column you are using, with the last tab in the group\nalways ending at a column\u2019s edge. The tabs in between will flow accordingly and\nmay or may not align with the grid, but they will always be the same width.\nExample shows the grid-aware switcher\u2019s text aligns on the grid.\nPlacement\nPlace the content switcher above the content area to create a clear hierarchy\nfor the section that the switcher controls. It can be aligned to the left or\nright side of the content area but should never be centered in the content\nspace.\nContent\nMain elements\nLabel text\nBe concise and specific and limit label text to two to three words.\nLabel text should communicate the view users will see and the content\ncontained in the view.\nLabel text should be nouns or noun phrases with as few characters as possible.\nAvoid phrasing label text as actions or long strings of text that could be\nmistaken for action buttons.\nDo phrase labels as nouns or noun phrases\nDo not phrase labels as actions\nOverflow content\nIf the label text is too long in a content tab, add an ellipsis\u00a0and accompany it\nwith a browser-based tooltip to show the full string of text. If a label is too\nlong to fit within its control tabs, consider using the icon modifier.\nContent switcher label text truncation\nFurther guidance\nFor further content guidance, see Carbon\u2019s\ncontent guidelines\n.\nBehaviors\nStates\nContent switchers have two main enabled states:\nunselected\nand\nselected\n.\nOther interactive states are\nhover\n,\nfocus\n, and\ndisabled\n. Learn more\nabout states on the\nStyle\ntab.\nState\nWhen to use\nUnselected\nWhen the first content tab is automatically selected.\nSelected\nWhen the content tab(s) after the first one is unselected.\nHover\nWhen the user hovers the cursor over an unselected content tab.\nFocus\nWhen the user\u00a0presses the right or left arrow, or clicks on the content tab, it becomes focused, indicating the user has successfully navigated to the targeted content tab.\nDisabled\nWhen a user cannot interact with the entire content switcher or a content tab. The entire content switcher or the content tabs could be temporarily inactive or unavailable.\nInteractions\nMouse\nUsers can activate and navigate between content switcher tabs by clicking a\ncontent tab.\nKeyboard\nUsers can activate the content switcher by pressing\ntab\nCopy to clipboard\nand then navigating\nbetween content switcher tabs by pressing the\nleft\nCopy to clipboard\nor\nright\nCopy to clipboard\narrow.\nUsers can choose to automatically change the selection on focus of the selected\ncontent tab, or manually change the focus state of the unselected content tab\nbetween tabs. For additional keyboard interactions, see the\nAccessibility\ntab.\nResponsive behavior\nIcon content switchers are compact and do not take up much screen space,\ntherefore they often work in different screen sizes. Where necessary, icon\ncontent switchers can also be used as a responsive replacement for content\nswitchers.\nExample shows the text content switcher turns into the icon content switcher\nin a smaller screen size.\nDefault selection\nThe default view typically preselects one tab, usually the first tab. Only one\ncontent tab can be selected at a time, displaying its content. When a user\nchooses a new item, the previous tab deselects automatically, and the new item\nbecomes selected. The first content tab in the switcher should be determined by\nusage and consistently serve as the default selection.\nClickable areas\nThe content tab is clickable anywhere within the container.\nText and icon content switchers with their clickable areas\nModifiers\nHigh and low contrast\nThe content switcher is set to the high contrast style by default. However,\nCarbon also supports a low contrast style. High contrast content switchers are\nbest suited for placement at a higher level in page hierarchy, such as at the\ntop of a page or within a page header. When in doubt, use the high contrast\nstyle.\nHigh contrast content switcher (top); low contrast content switcher (bottom)\nLow contrast content switchers may be used where they need to be less visually\ndisruptive, such as in cards, modals, and when the component is placed near\nprimary or secondary buttons.\nExample of a low contrast content switcher in a UI\nContent switcher with icons\nUse icons instead of label text to indicate alternative views of similar or\nrelated content. Icon content switchers are often used when space is limited or\nwhen icons can adequately describe the sections (for example, a list view versus\na card view).\nDo use consistent icon or text content switcher sections\nDo not mix icon and text content switcher sections\nRelated\nTabs\nTabs are used to organize related content.
