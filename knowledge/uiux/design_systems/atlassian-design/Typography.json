  "content": "Typography\nTypography is our system of fonts and text styles. It enhances communication, reinforces brand, and guides users' emotions.\nOverview\nWe have moved our app suite to a refreshed typography system. Using our\napp (product) typefaces\n,\nAtlassian Sans and Atlassian Mono, will create a consistent experience across all browsers. As apps\nmove to this system, we provide support to help transition smoothly between systems.\nTypographic principles\nFollow these principles to create legible and visually balanced typography. Use in conjunction with\nthe Atlassian\ncolor tokens\nand\nspace tokens\nin app experiences.\nOptimize for readability\nHelp readers understand communications easily and enhance their experience, regardless of their abilities.\nCreate visual harmony\nTypography should be consistent and cohesive. Use visual hierarchy and space to simplify complex information.\nContextualize for different users\nTailor for different preferences, operating systems and applications, while keeping in mind how people consume and process information.\nBrand fonts\nWhen you need to express the Atlassian brand, such as in marketing, we use our custom brand font,\nCharlie Sans. Only authenticated users can download our\nbrand fonts\n.\nApp fonts\nFor all in-app experiences, we use our Atlassian fonts,\nAtlassian Sans\nand\nAtlassian Mono\n.\nThis ensures the UI is optimized, performs well and is frictionless as you move between Atlassian\napps and experiences regardless of platform. For apps not yet using our refreshed system, we use\nsystem fonts via our modernized or legacy systems.\nAll app fonts are available for download in\nAtlassian Mosaic\nin\nTTF format.\nText styles and tokens\nText styles and typography tokens are made up of specific font values, including font family, font\nsize, and line height. Where text styles appear in design and Figma, typography tokens are used in\ncode.\nUse heading, body and code text styles and tokens in your designs. Each style has optimized spacing\nvalues based on font size, and is designed to work with our other foundations such as spacing and\ncolor. These typographic decisions are built into typography tokens and will enable typography\ntheming in the future.\nWe also recommend using heading and text components in code to simplify implementation of typography\ntokens.\nLearn more about\napplying typography tokens and text styles\n.\nRem units in tokens\nTypography tokens use\nrem units\ninstead of pixel values for font-size and line-heights. Font size is calculated dynamically by\nmultiplying the rem unit with the browser default size of 16px (i.e. 1rem is equal to 16px).\nUnlike pixels which are absolute (or fixed), rem are relative units that adjust according to the\nroot element (html) size. Using rem units allow users to adjust the size of text depending on their\nneeds or browser size, improving the responsiveness and accessibility of designs.\nHeading\nUse headings for page titles or subheadings to introduce content. Headings are sized to contrast\nwith content, increase visual hierarchy, and help readers easily understand the structure of\ncontent.\nHeadings should be used to introduce a new section of content. Use heading styles, rather than bold\nor a change of font size, as they\u2019re important for accessibility.\nHeading levels help users navigate a page, especially users of screen readers and other assistive\ntechnology. Using the right heading levels also helps to group content so it\u2019s easier to scan.\nHeading levels (\n<h1>\nto\n<h6>\n) should be used in a descending sequence. Only use one h1 per page\n(usually the page title) and don\u2019t skip a level (for example, use an h2 then an h4).\nHeadings come in a range of sizes, for use in different contexts:\nXXL\nand\nXL\nare suitable for brand and marketing content.\nXL\nand\nL\nare suitable for page titles in apps such as a form title.\nM\ncan be used in large components where space is not limited and perfectly balances with Body\nM, such as modals.\nS\nand\nXS\nare for titles in small components where space is limited, such as flags.\nXXS\nshould be used sparingly and is suitable when matched with Body S, for example, in fine\nprint.\nPreview\nToken\nFont weight\nFont size\nLine height\nAa\nfont.heading.xxlarge\nBold\n2 rem / 32 px\n2.25 rem / 36 px\nAa\nfont.heading.xlarge\nBold\n1.75 rem / 28 px\n2 rem / 32 px\nAa\nfont.heading.large\nBold\n1.5 rem / 24 px\n1.75 rem / 28 px\nAa\nfont.heading.medium\nBold\n1.25 rem / 20 px\n1.5 rem / 24 px\nAa\nfont.heading.small\nBold\n1 rem / 16 px\n1.25 rem / 20 px\nAa\nfont.heading.xsmall\nBold\n0.875 rem / 14 px\n1.25 rem / 20 px\nAa\nfont.heading.xxsmall\nBold\n0.75 rem / 12 px\n1 rem / 16 px\nBody\nUse body text for main content. They typically appear after headings or subheadings as detailed\ndescriptions and messages, but also as standalone text in components. Body text includes additional\nparagraph spacing for readability and flow in blocks of text.\nBody text comes in three sizes, for use in different contexts:\nBody L\nis the default size for long-form content.

Three weights are available for body text:\nRegular\nweight is for generic paragraphs to contrast with headings, and medium text in\ncomponents.\nMedium\nweight is for alignment with iconography. Use this weight in most components and\nwhenever text could be seen beside line icons.\nBold\nweight is for unique cases where text needs to be differentiated or given more emphasis.\nUse this weight sparingly.\nMetric\nUse metric when you want to emphasize certain numbers.
