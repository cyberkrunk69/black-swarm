They create a blank canvas\nwhere other UI will be placed, such as text, icons, backgrounds, and borders.\nMost elevations consist of surfaces and shadows. Together, surfaces and shadows give the impression\nof lift or depth. Elevations can guide focus through layering, or indicate that the UI can be\nscrolled, slid, or dragged.\nApplying elevations\nThe elevations use\ndesign tokens\nto apply different\nsurface levels. The highest two elevation surfaces, raised and overlay, are paired with shadows to\ncreate more depth.\nElevations in dark theme\nShadows can be harder to see in dark mode, so dark mode elevations also rely on different surface\ncolors. Imagine that the surfaces are distantly lit from the front \u2014 the higher the elevation, the\nlighter the surface looks.\nRaised and overlay surfaces are still paired with shadows for added depth and consistency in dark\nmode.\nTypes of elevations\nThere are four basic elevation levels:\nSunken\nDefault\nRaised\nOverlay\nThere is also one \"\noverflow\n\" elevation for special cases.\nSunken\nSunken is the lowest elevation available. The sunken surface creates a backdrop (or well) where\nother content sits. Columns on a Kanban board are a good example of the sunken elevation.\nOnly use sunken surfaces on the default surface level. Don\u2019t apply sunken elevations on raised or\noverlay elevations. To differentiate areas of the UI in other ways, use whitespace or borders\ninstead.\nUsing\nelevation.surface.sunken\nvs\ncolor.background.neutral\nAlthough\nelevation.surface.sunken\nand\ncolor.background.neutral\ntokens may appear similar in\nlight mode, they behave differently in dark mode. Here are the main differences between the two:\nelevation.surface.sunken\nis an opaque (solid) token that darkens in both light and dark modes. Use\nthis token as a backdrop to group content or elements together (such as a kanban board) on the\ndefault surface.\ncolor.background.neutral\nis a token that uses a transparent color. It darkens in light mode and\nlightens in dark mode. Use this token when you need the background to adapt to different elevations,\nwhich is relevant in dark mode since surfaces change depending on what elevation you\u2019re on.\nDefault\nThe default elevation is the baseline with respect to all other layers. It represents a flat UI\nsurface with no visual lift, such as a Confluence page.\nUse\nelevation.surface\nas the starting point for body content when building a UI. To create flat\ncards, pair with a border.\nRaised\nRaised elevations sit slightly higher than default elevations. They are reserved for cards that can\nbe moved, such as Jira and Trello cards. In special circumstances, they can be used for cards as a\nway to provide additional heirarchy or emphasis.\nAlways pair\nelevation.surface.raised\nwith\nelevation.shadow.raised\n. This is particularly\nimportant in dark mode, where raised surfaces are lighter to help differentiate elevations.\nDo\nUse raised elevations intentionally. If using for emphasis, limit to one section or focal point of the screen.\nDon\u2019t\nRaised elevations can create visual noise, so don\u2019t use to group content when a border or white space would suffice.\nOverlay\nOverlay is the highest elevation available. It is reserved for a UI that sits over another UI, such\nas modals, dialogs, dropdown menus, floating toolbars, and floating single-action buttons.\nAlways pair\nelevation.surface.overlay\nwith\nelevation.shadow.overlay\n. This is important in dark\nmode, where overlay surfaces are lighter to help differentiate elevations.\nOverlays can stack on top of other overlays.\nOverflow\nOverflow is a shadow indicating content has\nscrolled\noutside a view. It can be used for\nvertical or horizontal scroll. An example of overflow shadows is the horizontal scroll in tables on\na Confluence page.\nIf box shadows are not technically feasible, use the combination of\nelevation.shadow.overflow.spread\nand\nelevation.shadow.overflow.perimeter\nto replicate the\noverflow shadow.\nInteraction states\nHovered and pressed\nElevations use surface color changes to communicate hovered and pressed states. Use the hovered and\npressed elevation tokens to create these visual changes.\nTransitions between elevations can be used as an alternative to hovered and pressed tokens, but only\nfor default and raised elevations (not overlays):\nTransition to overlay elevation on hover\nTransition to raised elevation on press\nThis approach should be used sparingly to avoid excessive animation. It should not be used for very\nsmall UI, as elevation changes are harder to see than surface color changes at this size.\nDo\nUse the recommended hovered and pressed tokens for interaction states on elevations.\nDon\u2019t\nDon\u2019t combine elevation transitions and hovered and pressed tokens for interactive states. Use one or the other.\nBackground change example\nDefault\nDefault (bordered)\nRaised\nOverlay\nStyles\n// Default:\nBackground color: elevation.surface\nHovered background color: elevation.surface.hovered\nPressed background color: elevation.surface.pressed\n// Default (bordered):\nBackground color: elevation.surface\nHovered background color: elevation.surface.hovered\nPressed background color: elevation.surface.pressed\nBorder: 1px solid color.border\n// Raised:\nBackground color: elevation.surface.raised\nHovered background color: elevation.surface.raised.hovered\nPressed background color: elevation.surface.raised.pressed\nShadow: elevation.shadow.raised\n// Overlay\nBackground color: elevation.surface.overlay\nHovered background color: elevation.surface.overlay.hovered\nPressed background color: elevation.surface.overlay.pressed\nShadow: elevation.shadow.overlay\nShow more\nElevation change example\nDefault\nDefault (bordered)\nRaised\nStyles\n// Default:\nBackground color: elevation.surface\nHovered background color: elevation.surface.overlay\nPressed background color: elevation.surface.raised\nHovered shadow: elevation.shadow.overlay\nPressed shadow: elevation.shadow.raised\n// Default (with border)\nBackground color: elevation.surface\nHovered background color: elevation.surface.overlay\nPressed background color: elevation.surface.raised\nBorder: 1px solid color.border\nHovered shadow: elevation.shadow.overlay\nPressed shadow: elevation.shadow.raised\n// Raised\nBackground color: elevation.surface.raised\nHovered background color: elevation.surface.overlay\nPressed background color: elevation.surface.raised\nShadow: elevation.shadow.raised\nHovered shadow: elevation.shadow.overlay\nPressed shadow: elevation.shadow.raised\nShow more\nDragged\nUse the overlay elevation for any UI that is being dragged. Once moved, it returns to its original\nelevation.\nScrolled\nWhen scrollable content exceeds the available area, a border or\noverflow\nshadow can be\napplied at the point the content is cut off to indicate there is hidden content that can be scrolled\nback into view.\nA border is the default approach for scrolled content and can be seen in modal sticky headers and\nfooters, and top and side navigation.\nOverflow\nshadows are reserved for experiences where a border might be easily missed,\nsuch as in very small UI or tables that use borders to separate cells.\nBoth approaches should apply the appropriate surface token where the content is being hidden.\nAll elevation tokens and values\nFor the full list of elevation design tokens and their values, see our\ndesign token reference list\n. Every token\ncomes with a description to help you ensure you\u2019re using the correct one.\nBest practices\nFollow the recommended surface and shadow pairings\nRaised and overlay elevations have dedicated surface and shadow pairings.\nDo\nWhen creating elevations, always pair matching surface and shadow tokens.\nDon\u2019t\nDon't mix different shadow and surface elevation tokens.\nReplace elevation surfaces with background colors only when required\nElevation surfaces use our\nneutral palettes\n. If a different color\nis needed, surface tokens can be swapped for any solid background token. When using background\ntokens, align to the behavior of\ninteraction states for color tokens\n.\nAvoid excessive use of raised and overlay elevations\nThe shadows and surfaces of raised and overlay elevations can create busy UI if not applied\nintentionally. Follow the recommended guidance when considering these elevations.\nDo\nLimit the use of overlay elevations by grouping related buttons together in a floating toolbar if they are required to sit over another UI.\nDon\u2019t\nDon\u2019t have more than one floating button next to each other.\nCheck contrast ratios\nAlways make sure your elevation and background choices are accessible.\nDo\nCheck the contrast ratio for UI on overlay surfaces in dark mode to ensure it meets accessibility requirements.\nDon\u2019t\nDon't assume that because UI is accessible in light mode, it will be in dark mode. Some UI may need tweaking.\nZ-index\nThe z-index determines the stacking order of elements. Elements with a higher z-index always sit in\nfront of elements with a lower z-index.\nDifferent UI can have the same elevation style, but each UI should apply a different z-index to\nindicate the layer(s) order in a stack (or where the elements touch).\nZ-index\nExample usage\nElevation level\n100\nNone\nNone\n200\nAtlassian navigation\nDefault\n300\nInline dialog\nOverlay\n400\nPopup\nOverlay\n500\nBlanket\nNone\n510\nModal\nOverlay\n600\nFlag\nOverlay\n700\nSpotlight\nOverlay\n800\nTooltip\nNone\nRelated\nLearn about the basics of\ndesign tokens\n.\nSee the list of\nall design tokens\nfor\nfull descriptions and values for all tokens.\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nWe use this feedback to improve our documentation.",
