Applying these\nguidelines helps customers quickly understand the relationship between elements, allowing them to\nscan and digest page content with ease.\nUse these guidelines in combination with space tokens to create layouts that are consistent and easy\nto understand.\nGroup by similarity\nUsers expect elements to be grouped semantically, or grouped in such a way that it provides greater\ncontext around the information provided.\nUsing consistent spacing around elements lends them a visual similarity that helps the user\nunderstand their semantic relationship. For example, a table or list of items should be spaced\nconsistently to create the sense of a cohesive unit or collection.\nDo\nGroup similar items together using similar spacing.\nDon\u2019t\nGroup similar items differently.\nGroup by proximity\nThe distance between elements creates semantic meaning, elements that are placed close to one\nanother are assumed to be related.\nUse this principle to create meaning by placing more related objects closer together, and less\nrelated objects further apart. For example, place elements that are part of the same flow or user\naction closer together so users can understand their relation.\nDo\nGroup related items close together so that users can scan the content more easily.\nDon\u2019t\nGroup related items far apart.\nCreate order and hierarchy\nUsers look for order in visual information to reduce the mental effort required to scan and process\ndata. Therefore, the ordering of elements on a page can be used to encourage users to follow a\ncertain flow or journey.\nHierarchy is used to rank elements and influence the order in which users view them. The sizing of\ndifferent elements lends more importance to larger elements by drawing focus, and less to\nsmaller-sized elements. Similarly, varying the amount of whitespace around an element can be used to\ngroup elements together or separate them to impart greater importance.\nDo\nUse scale and whitespace to rank elements.\nDon\u2019t\nGive every element the same visual importance.\nIntroduce visual rhythm\nPatterns of alternating elements and white space create visual rhythm, which influences way users\nscan a page and focus their attention.\nUsing a pattern of similar spacing between elements (such as in a table or list) creates a\npredictable rhythm for the user to follow. This consistent rhythm reinforces the similarity in\nimportance of each of these elements.\nVarying the spacing between and sizing of objects creates a more organic flow and guides the user\nthrough a page or experience naturally. Variation creates points of attention and contrast between\nobjects on the page and improves scannability.\nUse optical adjustment\nWhile using a spacing system improves consistency, the visual harmony of a page may not be perfect\nthe first time. The visual weight of an element affects the size and spacing that may be required to\ncreate balance on the page, and may deviate from standard spacing patterns. Optical adjustments\nshould be used to correct these imbalances and maintain the page\u2019s flow.\nOptical adjustments require using the spacing scale units and visual intuition to make minor changes\nto the spacing between objects in order to create visual harmony.\nDo\nAdjust spacing to create visual balance.\nDon\u2019t\nUse standard spacing without considering its alignment with other elements.\nRelated\nLearn more about\ndesign tokens\nList of all design tokens\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nWe use this feedback to improve our documentation.",
