However, you still need to review your patterns, content, and interactions so your app is\naccessible end-to-end.\n\n### Follow our accessibility principles\n\nOur principles cover the main requirements to design and build accessible experiences, helping you\nto put accessibility into action.\n\n#### Build consistent experiences\n\nThe user experience should be familiar, identifiable, and work as expected regardless of device,\nscreen size, platform, or assistive technology.\n\n- Use design system components as the basis of every experience. They have inbuilt accessibility\n  features and create consistency across apps.\n- Ensure the same components, patterns, and interactions are used for the same experiences across\n  pages and apps to lessen cognitive load.\n\n#### Keep experiences and language simple\n\nRespect people\u2019s time by making apps that are uncomplicated and easy to use.\n\n- Avoid complex process and experiences.\n- Use similar patterns across apps and experiences.\n- Use concise and plain language.\n- Aim for content to be written at a reading level of ages 12 to 14.\n\n#### Be inclusive\n\nAccessible design is inclusive of people of all races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations,\nand backgrounds.\n\n- Use [inclusive language](https://atlassian.design/foundations/content/inclusive-writing).\n- Don\u2019t make assumptions about people\u2019s abilities.\n- Avoid jargon,\n  [metaphors, and non-literal phrases](https://atlassian.design/foundations/content/inclusive-writing#avoid-metaphors-and-idioms).\n\n#### Give people control\n\nPeople should be able to adapt our apps to suit their needs.\n\n- Enable [reflow](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html) across all screen sizes.\n- Allow people to adjust scale, contrast, and colors.\n- Make sure personal reduced motion settings are respected by our apps.\n- Inform people about high-impact changes before you make them.\n\n#### Provide text alternatives\n\nText is powerful for assistive technologies, as it can be seen on a screen, heard using\ntext-to-speech, and touched with a braille screen reader.\n\n- Use visible and accessible labels.\n- Write clear and concise labels and\n  [alternative (alt) text](https://accessibility.huit.harvard.edu/describe-content-images).\n- Include a transcript for videos on the page or link to it.\n\n#### Ensure color is accessible\n\nSome people can\u2019t perceive color, while others perceive limited color.\n\n- Never rely on color alone to convey meaning.\n- Use a color contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for regular text and 3:1 for large text and graphics.\n\n#### Use semantic HTML\n\n[Semantic HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) describes the exact\nmeaning of an element to a web browser. It helps people using assistive technology navigate and\ninterpret page elements.\n\n- Use `header` , `nav`, `footer` (for example).\n- Don't use `div` or `span` (for example) as they don't convey meaning.\n\n#### Test apps broadly\n\nTest with different tools and a diverse array of people.\n\n- Test apps with people with disabilities and across different levels of technical experience.\n- Use different types of technology and accessibility tools, such as\n  [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io), to test your app.\n\n## What to consider when building accessible apps\n\nEveryone will experience a disability at some point in their lives, whether it's a situational\nimpairment or a permanent or temporary disability.
