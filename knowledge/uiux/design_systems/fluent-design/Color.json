A standardized color palette and its intentional application ensure a familiar, comfortable, and consistent experience.\nFluent palettes\nFluent defines three color palettes: neutral, shared, and brand.

These colors are used on surfaces, text, and layout elements. When used in components, they often connote a change in state.\nVisual hierarchy using neutrals\nUse lighter neutrals on surfaces to highlight areas of primary focus and create a sense of hierarchy.
