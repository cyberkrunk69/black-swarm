Their primary role is to identify a Microsoft capability and the collaboration and productivity it enables. They can also allow people to take an action, like buying, downloading, or launching the app.\nThese icons draw a connection to our Microsoft brand, but they do not represent the company and should never be used in place of the Microsoft logo.\nScaling down\nAs the product icons scale below 48 pixels, they simplify in detail in favor of readability. Use icons at specific sizes, instead of scaling them, to create pixel-perfect results.\nScaling up\nWhen scaling product icons larger than 48 pixels, use the full-fidelity icon and scale by factors of four, (48, 64, 96\u00e2\u0080\u00a6). Scaling to 4x the base icon, i.e. 48 pixels to 192 pixels, ensures pixel perfection.\nFile type icons\nFile type icons indicate specific files or file formats.\nSize and format\nMulticolor file type icons look best at 16, 48, and 96 pixel sizes in most Microsoft UIs.\nThese icons are available as SVGs and.webps. SVGs are vectors and are therefore more versatile and can be resized easily, but not all browsers support SVGs.
