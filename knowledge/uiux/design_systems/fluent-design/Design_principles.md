# Design principles

Design principles are a set of values that express a shared vision and help guide decision making. They influence how product designers approach and solve problems. We believe our Fluent principles will guide our product experiences for years to come. Theyâre grounded in our deep understanding of how customers navigate the world, andÂ areÂ rooted in our beliefsÂ aboutÂ what empowers people to achieve more.

## Natural on every platform

You want to know what to do. Your experiences should adapt to the device youâre on and should build off the familiarâdesigning for what you already understand.

### What makes it functional?

A layout that adapts to different screen sizes and is aware of the platformÂ itâsÂ on makes an experience feel natural. It also allows us to reuse native platform components and patterns 80% of the time, focusing our energy on signature experiencesÂ instead.

### What makes it emotional?

ExperiencesÂ areÂ intuitive and expected, creating a feeling of reliability andÂ trust.

## Built for focus

You want to stay in the flow.â¯â Your experiences should inspire action, drawing you forward, simply and seamlessly.

### What makes it functional?

When technology communicates and performs it enables people to do what they want on their terms. Our products shouldnât get in the way.

### What makes it emotional?

Less visual clutter and noise keeps people centered, calm, and confident.

## One for all, all for one

You want to be included. Your experiences should consider, learn, and reflect a range of perspectives and abilities for the benefit of all.

### What makes it functional?

Including and learning from a variety of people with a range of abilities and perspectives earlier in the design process makes for better solutions. It opens up new possibilities and helps us think more creatively through constraints.

### What makes it emotional?

When youâre included, you feel like you belong.

## Unmistakably Microsoft

You want to recognize what youâre looking for. Your experiences should feel like one Microsoft. One moment, one product, one experience at a time.

### What makes it functional?

We focus our energy on signature experiences that connect our products together and give them a distinctively Microsoft feel. From color to sound, illustration to icons, these signature experiences increase brand recognition and familiarity.â

### What makes it emotional?

A little personality goes a long way.
