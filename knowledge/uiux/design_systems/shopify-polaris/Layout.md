# Layout

Layout determines the placement, positioning, and organization of various components within the UI, such as buttons, menus, content sections, and other visual elements.

## Space defines proximity

Space plays a vital role in establishing connections between items. The principle of proximity states that the closer objects are, the stronger their perceived relationship.

Grouping similar items together helps merchants understand which elements are
related and helps them make faster decisions.

Do

Group similar data points or tasks in the same card.

Do

Nest inset shapes and surfaces.

## Emphasis creates hierarchy

In the Shopify admin, larger, heavier, and contrasting elements attract attention and create visual rhythm.

Smaller, lighter, and more subtle elements are work-oriented and provide detailed information.

Use size, weight, and contrast to establish hierarchy in the admin. Divider
lines are used to delimit rows of information in data and index tables, and
rarely for dividing information elsewhere.

Do

Use weight and contrast to introduce sections of the UI.

Don't

Use divider lines to create visual hierarchy or separation outside of indexes of tables.

## Software, not website

Since the admin is more like software, rather than a website, elements need to be sized appropriately based on their job.

information](/images/design/layout/layout-overview-07-adapt@2x.png)

Compact elements add detail, and larger elements command more attention.
Surfaces adapt to these components and offer an optimized view of the admin.

Do

Create compact components for specialized, minute tasks.

![A tag component with large tags presented as a list, each taking the entire space of a row, with a large “add tag” button in the upper right corner](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdesign%2Flayout%2Flayout-overview-09-adapt-dont%402x.png&w=1920&q=75)

Don't

Contradict the importance of a task with its size in the admin.
