  "content": "Text fields can be grouped in a form or placed individually in the UI. Placeholder text should generally be avoided in text fields. Help text can be used below the text input area to guide the user on acceptable inputs.\nField labels\nField labels act as a title for the text field. Labels should typically be short and in noun form. For example, \u201cName\u201d.\nDo\nDon't\nEdge case: When a text field isn\u2019t part of a form and is placed individually on a page (like a comment field), then you can write the field label as a call to action. For example, \u201cLeave a comment\u201d. This is because there\u2019s no surrounding context and using \u201cComment\u201d alone could be confusing.\nDo\nDon't\nPlaceholder text\nIn general, avoid using placeholder text in text fields. It can pose a range of accessibility problems, like:\nLow color contrast, making the text hard to read\nInconsistent behavior between browsers and screen readers\nText disappearing when the user starts typing, which can be confusing to people with cognitive impairments\nLimited space available for additional context, due to field size\nException: Read the guidelines on\nsearch fields\n.\nHelp text\nHelp text provides extra guidance or instructions to people filling out a form field. It can also be used to clarify how the information will be used.\nUse help text:\nwhen the text field label doesn\u2019t clearly explain the purpose of the text input\nto provide guidance or instructions on the type of information needed\nto show examples of the required format for modeled text inputs\nBest practices:\nAvoid repeating the field label. If the field label provides sufficient context for completing the action, then you likely don\u2019t need to add help text.\nIf there\u2019s not enough room to include both instructions and an example, then only include the example.\nDo\nDon't\nText input types\nThere are three types of text inputs:\nModeled text inputs\nThese are fields that require a specific format to be valid. They\u2019re often used for tags, dates, and some tracking numbers. Modeled text is highly structured, so providing examples is useful.\nRead more\nFree text inputs\nThese are fields that accept short strings of text. They\u2019re often used for SKUs, barcodes, and titles. Only provide example text if you know how the text should be structured, such as a tracking number or discount code.\nRead more\nMultiline text inputs\nThese are fields that are rendered as multiline textarea elements, as well as text input elements that accept long strings of text. They\u2019re often used for product descriptions, order comments, and customer notes. Users can write whatever they want, so providing example text is less useful.\nRead more\nModeled text inputs\nModeled text inputs are text field inputs that require text to be formatted in a specific way. For instance, tags need to be separated by commas, and dates need to be typed in YYYY-MM-DD format. Because modeled text inputs require a particular structure, always include examples that demonstrate how the user should enter the information.\nUse help text to include an instructional call to action and an example that shows the required text format\nIf there\u2019s not enough room to include both an instructional call to action and an example, then include only the example\nUse the word \u201cExample\u201d followed by a colon to introduce the example (instead of e.g.)\nDo\nDon't\nFree text inputs\nFree text inputs accept a single string of text, without any particular structure. Use the field label to clearly indicate what should go in the text field.\nDon\u2019t provide an example for free text inputs. The text doesn\u2019t follow a specific format, and we shouldn\u2019t assume what belongs in the field. If more context is needed, use help text.\nAvoid redundancy\nIf a text field label has a call to action, there's no need to repeat it in the help text. Instead, add a sentence that provides extra context.\nFor example, when a free text input is located independent of a form and has no surrounding context, you can make the field label a call to action.\nPoint in the right direction\nIf the text field label isn\u2019t clear about where the user can find the information, use help text to guide them.\nTitles, names, and descriptions\nDon\u2019t use placeholder text for free input titles, names, and descriptions; use help text instead.\nDo\nDon't\nCodes and tracking numbers\nDon\u2019t use placeholder text for codes or tracking numbers; use help text instead. If the code follows a standardized format, include an example, using the same format as help text for modeled content. If not, omit the example since the field\u2019s contents can vary.\nChoose clear names for the field label, and don\u2019t repeat it in the help text if possible. Instead, offer context that will help the user understand and complete the task quickly.\nDo\nDon't\nMultiline text inputs\nMultiline fields let merchants type long blocks of text. There are a few different versions:\nPlain textarea elements with no formatting options\nFormatted textarea elements with what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) menus\nPlain text input elements that accept long strings of text\nPlain text input elements that accept long strings of text and expand as the user types\nMultiline inputs hold things like product and collection descriptions, notes about an order that only store staff can access, notes that the customer can access, and anything else the merchant wants to type into them.\nWe usually don\u2019t know what will go in multiline fields, so providing example text isn\u2019t helpful. Instead, include help text that explains how the text will be used and who can view it.\nDo\nDon't\nComments and notes\nDon\u2019t use placeholder text for comments and notes; use help text instead. Comments and notes help merchants keep track of unstructured information they may need about an order or a buyer.\nSome comments and notes are not visible to customers, but some are. In the help text, describe clearly who will be able to view the note.\nDo\nDon't\nSearch and email fields\nFor standard text fields, avoid placeholder text. However, regular or floating placeholder text can be used for:\nSearch fields\nFilter fields\nEmail entry fields\nPlaceholder text is a common, recognizable pattern for these field types. Moving the placeholder text outside of the text field box may seem out of place and negatively impact the visual design of some marketing pages.\nTo make search, filter, and email entry fields more accessible, always move the placeholder text above the cursor while the field is in focus. This lets the user read the placeholder text as soon as they select the field.\nMinimalist page design and placeholders\nThere are some cases where help text clutters a page. For example, the minimalist design of pages like the admin login page would be significantly changed by adding another line of text.\nAs with standard placeholder text, the placeholder should float above the text entry once the field has been selected. It\u2019s not easy for everyone to read the small print of the floating text, so use this method sparingly.",
