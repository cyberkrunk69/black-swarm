  "content": "Internationalization\nMake commerce better for everyone by building interfaces that work everywhere. These guidelines will help you design, write, and build products that can be used in every part of the world.\nWe want our merchants to experience Shopify in a way that\u2019s appropriate and meaningful to them, no matter where they are in the world.\nWe aim to build one experience that works for all merchants in all of our markets. However, when a certain experience doesn\u2019t fit a specific market, we should tailor it.\nDefinitions\nInternationalization\nBuilding your product and interface so they can be used in different locales. This includes creating flexible interfaces that allow for text expansion and changes to word order.\nLocalization\nAdapting your product and interface for different locales to make them a good cultural fit. This includes adapting features, changing visuals, and translating text.\nTranslation\nConverting text from one language to another. Not to be confused with localization, translation is just one part of localizing a product.\nLocale\nA linguistic region defined by both its language and country. Examples:\nFrench-France (fr-FR); French-Canada (fr-CA); Portuguese-Brazil (pt-BR). Note that languages and countries won\u2019t always have a 1:1 mapping.\nPlan for text expansion\nWhen interfaces are localized, the content will often expand in length. In most languages, text is up to 50% longer on average than English. Some non-Latin languages, such as Japanese, take up more vertical space. For character-based languages, text wrapping and line breaking can\u2019t always rely on spaces to separate words. Your interface needs to be flexible enough to accommodate language-specific formatting and text expansion without changing its context of use.\nDo\nLay out your elements in a way where text expansion doesn\u2019t hinder your information hierarchy.\nDon't\nDon\u2019t rely on responsive stacking alone. It can often change the hierarchy of information of the layout. In this case, the text expansion causes the line break at the wrong spot, placing the button in the middle of the heading and content of this card.\nDo\nUse single columns to stack elements flexibly to accomodate for text expansion.\nDon't\nAvoid using narrow columns in smaller components. Ensure the right amount of padding for a clean interface.\nTips\nAlways assume the worst-case scenario for text length, especially on mobile and in layouts such as tables and columns. Avoid using narrow columns.\nPay particular attention to content elements that only have a few words. In English, labels and buttons\nexclude words such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201cthe\u201d\n, but many other languages need to include them. Overall these small pieces of text may expand up to 300%.\nOur components are designed to be expandable, but you should still test them in your designs and builds. Check the CSS layout to make sure text doesn\u2019t overflow when the screen size is reduced.\nWork with linguistic experts to review line breaks and word wrapping for character-based languages, like Chinese or Japanese, to ensure they don\u2019t break sentences.\nPlan for changes in word order\nWord order can change dramatically in translation. If the layout and functionality of your interface is dependent on a certain word order, it\u2019s likely to break when localized.\nDo\nIf content elements need to stay in a certain position on the page, implement them as separate labels, outside of sentences.\nDon't\nDon\u2019t place elements with a fixed position inside a sentence. The order of this sentence would often need to change in translation, which is impossible to do if the interface is built this way.\nDo\nWhen including links in body text, only use a single and descriptive term or a small part of a phrase as the link. Find out more about\nlinks\n.\nDon't\nDon\u2019t use full phrases as links. Word order changes might break the link into several parts when translated.\nTips\nAssume the word order of every sentence in your interface will change when translated.\nAvoid using UI components to build sentences.\nAvoid splitting one sentence into several strings, known as concatenated strings. If you use concatenated strings, translators won\u2019t be able to change the word order and their translations won\u2019t make sense.\nAvoid using variables in your strings as it will translate differently.\nPlan for cultural differences\nMerchants in each locale have different cultural sensibilities. Use visuals, content, and interface formats that are useful and meaningful to merchants in all parts of the world.\nWhen possible, use universally known icons. Be mindful of when you use country-specific icons and where they are surfaced. Find out more about\nicons\n.\nBe mindful of using colors to represent meaning. Colors can hold discrete connotations in different cultures. For example, in North America, green is used to indicate success and red for failure, as opposed to China, where red symbolizes prosperity and good fortune.\nTips\nWhen using photos, illustrations, icons, or emojis, make sure the visuals you\u2019re using are not offensive or culturally insensitive. If you\u2019re unsure about a visual you\u2019re using, research it or ask someone with local knowledge.\nWhen naming features, be mindful of connotations in other cultures, especially for evocative names and acronyms. Find out more about\nnaming\n.\nAvoid colloquial words, idioms, and references to popular culture. It\u2019s difficult to translate them in a meaningful way.\nIn some cultures, a person\u2019s given name comes first, whereas in other cultures the family name comes first. Let merchants choose how they want to enter, read, and sort names, especially in text fields and lists.\nMany types of information, such as addresses, dates, numbers, and currencies, are shown in different formats in different locales. For example, some locales display currency symbols before the number, others display them after. Make sure these can be translated appropriately. Find out more about\nformatting localized currency\n.\nSome cultures expect more guidelines and instructions when filling in long or critical forms. Consider using asterisks to mark mandatory fields in a form to match that expectation.\nWork with people that have local knowledge if possible.\nInternationalize Polaris components\nWhen designing with a Polaris component, test the localized versions to make sure it still works with the rest of your interface.\nIf you need a certain component to adapt, but it hasn\u2019t yet been internationalized in Polaris, you can open a feature request in\nGitHub\n.",
