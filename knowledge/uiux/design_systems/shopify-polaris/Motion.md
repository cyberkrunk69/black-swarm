# Motion

Motion brings dynamism to an interface, offers visual feedback, and aids merchants understanding the outcomes of their actions.

## Purposeful

Motion has a clear purpose. It helps merchants understand the interface and the results of their actions, instead of being used as decoration or entertainment.

Don't

Allow motion to complicate the interface or hinder merchant comprehension.

## Responsive

Motion should be a reaction to merchant interactions, providing immediate visual feedback, and making the interface feel alive and responsive.

Do

Use motion to provide feedback on merchant actions. The scale of the motion
should match the scale of the action performed.

Don't

Use motion that doesn't correspond to merchants’ interactions and expectations.

## Snappy

Motion should feel quick and subtle.

A snappy animation starts rapidly, and slows down towards the end, making the transition feel quick while still providing a cue as to where things are coming from, making the motion feel more natural.

Do

Make motion feel snappy. This gives the animation a lively and energetic feel
that doesn’t get in the way of merchants.

Don't

Use abrupt, instant, or distracting motion, as these make it hard to follow
along with changes happening on the interface.
