Please share your thoughts in the\nGitHub discussion\n.\nPrinciples\nMake it fast.\nPlan and prioritize the loading to make it as short as possible.\nMake good use of time.\nGive merchants useful structure and content.\nFocus on the job.\nPut merchants' attention on what's important.\nMake it fast\nWe can speed up loading by planning how much data we load and when we load it. Figure out what content merchants will need first, and make it available as soon as possible.\nCache commonly needed data\nCaching data eliminates the loading time the next time it's needed. Consider caching data that is reused throughout an experience, such as the name and image of an item, and use that to show essential content while other content loads.\nPrefetch relevant data\nPrefetching data can save valuable loading time. Start prefetching when merchants show intent to need the data, such as when hovering over an interactive element.\nPrioritize viewport content\nThe content that is visible in the viewport is the content that merchants will likely need first. Make sure that such content isn't delayed by content that merchants won't need until after an interaction, such as scrolling or clicking a popover.\nLimit page content\nPages with a lot of content take longer to load. By limiting the page to meaningful content that merchants will need, we can speed up the loading and declutter the page. Use progressive disclosure to give merchants more content when they need it, and use\npagination\nto limit long lists. Remember to prefetch the data so that it's readily available.\nMake good use of time\nMerchants use the Shopify admin to get work done. Showing the right context, real page structure, and meaningful content will keep them engaged and prepare them for what\u2019s to come.\nSwitch to the next view quickly\nPeople expect to get the result of their interaction right away. When merchants navigate to a new page or view, it\u2019s typically best to move toward that context immediately, rather than load first and switch later. Sometimes that means reverting to the previous view in case of errors, but it\u2019s often a reasonable tradeoff when success is the most common outcome.\nUse highly accurate loading layouts\nThe page layout during loading should allow merchants to scan and understand the page structure. Matching layouts set clear expectations and make merchants proactive. Mismatched layouts confuse merchants and waste their time. Test skeleton content with different breakpoints and make sure both the content and the layout represents the final state.\nShow real content\nShowing static content, such as section labels, icons, text, and imagery, gives merchants a head start in understanding the page. A small thing like a labeled card can enable them to anticipate what they need almost immediately. It\u2019s important that we make an effort to show as much real content as possible.\nShow active controls\nIdeally, controls are rendered active so merchants can take action before the page is done loading. For example, when a primary action like \"Add product\" is the same everywhere, then you could include it in the loading state.\nControls can often be rendered active even when the data behind it hasn\u2019t finished loading. Many times it will be done by the time the merchant interacts with it, and if not, show that it needs to finish loading then. Render it inactive only if it mustn\u2019t be interacted with, but use that as a last resort.\nGive hints with recognizable placeholders\nPlaceholders let merchants anticipate content type and location. Use placeholders for visually distinct elements, such as lists, images, controls, text, and data visualizations. This is the most important job\nskeleton content\ncan do. Don\u2019t use placeholders for content that could be rendered.\nAvoid details in the placeholder that may not appear. We don't want to draw attention to it and set false expectations.\nFocus on the job\nThe task and the content must always be the focus. Confusion and visual noise will distract merchants and waste their time.\nGive clear feedback on the interaction\nLoading is typically a consequence of merchants navigating to a new page or view. If it's unclear that their initializing interaction worked, then the experience will start with doubt and confusion.\nWhen the interaction feedback is clear, then the interaction is a thing of the past and they can make better use of their time. Make sure that the feedback is noticeable within 100 milliseconds and that it's clear what happened.\nShow real loading progress\nThe best way to inform people that the system is working is to show real progress. Real progress puts people\u2019s attention on the content while providing something useful to work with.\nProgress within 1 second is perceived as natural and continuous, which keeps people engaged in the task. When actual progress can be shown within 1 second intervals, merchants typically don't need any other loading indicators.\nMake the layout visually stable\nIt's very important that the layout doesn't unexpectedly change during the loading process. Merchants will engage with visible content, and unexpected change can confuse or cause them to misclick. Pay attention to layout shifts throughout loading, find out what causes them, and make an effort to remove them. Sometimes we can wait to render some layout until it\u2019s certain it will stay put. Learn more about layout shift and visual stability on\nweb.dev\n.\nMinimize visual noise\nMerchants get distracted by things changing on the screen. Pay attention to anything that changes during loading. Categorize the change as signal or noise, and use the following tips to address it.\nRemove avoidable visual noise.\nFor example, fix poorly matching placeholders or plan for unexpectedly appearing content.\nSubdue visual noise that is unavoidable.\nThis includes using transitions to make state changes less sudden such as fading in an image that might render late. When an element\u2019s size is unknown, such as a product index with a variable number of items, then it's typically better to add too many placeholder items than too few. It's less jarring when elements suddenly shrink than when they suddenly expand.\nEmphasize the visual change that matters.\nAnimate items in a list or the most important information on the screen. Emphasizing important content will guide merchants' attention to what they want, while also increasing tolerance for other visual changes.\nUse spinners when real progress isn't enough\nUse spinners when it\u2019s not clear that the system is working, but only when it will improve the user experience. Excessive use of loading indicators isn\u2019t informative. Rather, it can be overwhelming and make the system appear slow.\nAvoid using spinners as placeholders\nDefault to using more meaningful content where possible. If spinners are needed, place them where it\u2019s easy for merchants to understand what is loading. This helps drawing attention to the content that is about to appear and not to the spinner itself.\nAvoid empty views with spinners\nIt's important to provide useful content during loading. Being in the right visual context, seeing progress, or getting a glimpse of what's ahead can go a long way. Empty views with spinners provide low value and cause merchants to become passive and disengage.\nBe honest about lengthy loading times\nPeople are likely to be frustrated and abandon their tasks if loading times exceed 10 seconds. In such cases, it's better to set clear expectations and empower merchants to make an informed decision to wait. Put their attention on the value ahead to increase the likelihood that they stay engaged in the task.",
