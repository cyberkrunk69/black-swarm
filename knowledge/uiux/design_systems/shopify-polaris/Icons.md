# Icons

Icons enhance an experience by providing intuitive and efficient navigation, conveying information concisely, and making it more visually appealing.

## Clear

Icons are simple and effectively convey their intended meaning. Avoid unnecessary complexity that makes the icon difficult to recognize. The goal is to communicate quickly and clearly.

Don't

Embellish icons with unnecessary details.

## Consistent

Icons follow a cohesive visual style across the user interface. This includes a consistent use of line weights, shapes, dimensions, perspectives, and general style. Consistency in designs enables users to quickly recognize functionality and navigate the interface more intuitively.

Do

Reuse parts of other icons in the set to maintain visual harmony across all icons.

Do

Use universally recognized icons.

Don't

Reinterpret or stylize universally recognized icons.

## Universal

Universally recognized symbols and metaphors ensure icons are easily understood by a broad user base.

![Left: an icon composed with a shopping cart and an x sign. Right: an icon composed with a person and a plus sign.](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdesign%2Ficons%2Ficons-overview-universal-1%402x.png&w=1920&q=75)

Do

Leverage universally recognized symbols and metaphors to create new icons.

![An icon with a 2 euro coin representing the concept of “Money”; an icon with an american football representing the concept of “Sports”; and a floppy disk representing the concept of “Save”.](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdesign%2Ficons%2Ficons-overview-universal-2%402x.png&w=1920&q=75)

Don't

Relying on cultural-specific, niche, or outdated metaphors may not be suitable for all users.
