Sound patterns make interactions easier and more predictable.\nCaution\nThis section is currently being reworked to provide better guidance aligned\nwith Polaris v12. Stay tuned!\nPrinciples\nSelectively urgent\nThe duration, volume, and character of a sound should all be dictated by the level of urgency of an event. For example, an alert indicating that a customer is struggling to complete checkout requires more urgent attention and immediate action. An alert indicating that a customer has arrived at a storefront is informative, but doesn\u2019t require immediate action. The sounds used during these events should be customized to reflect the differences in urgency.\nAvoid annoying repetition\nSome sounds occur many times per day. While appealing on first listen, a sound may become irritating after ten, and unbearable after a hundred. Merchants that hear a sound repeatedly may quickly grow tired of it.\nOur sounds should be informative and not annoying.\nWhen possible, use data to determine how often a sound is triggered.\nDistinct and succinct\nMerchants are likely to hear our sounds in a variety of contexts. Clean, focused, and succinct sounds convey information better than muffled or distorted sounds.\nTest across devices\nWhile you may be testing your designs using headphones or loudspeakers that reveal the audible frequency spectrum clearly, a smartphone speaker will affect the quality of the sound. Smaller speakers are more susceptible to distortion. Sounds on mobile devices should be played at lower levels than on a desktop computer or laptop. Test sounds on a variety of devices and volume\u00a0levels.\nThink beyond sound\nSome people can\u2019t rely on sound to receive cues or notifications. Merchants may have a disability that affects hearing or auditory processing. Depending on the merchant\u2019s preferences and technologies, they may receive sound cues through haptic or visual feedback, but don\u2019t assume that they\u2019ll be able to perceive sound. Always include an alternative method to convey information, like text-based notifications or visual changes in the interface.\nWhen to use sound\nSounds in our product help convey information. There\u2019s an important balance between having too many sounds and not enough. Useful and well-planned sounds will help with merchant understanding. Unnecessary sounds will reduce the perceived quality of our product.\nEven though merchants might miss important information if they turn off their sound, we should always provide the option for them to do so.\nCommon sound events\nFor an event that requires a merchant\u2019s immediate attention, use an alert to encourage them to pause their workflow and take care of things.\nFor something that\u2019s useful for a merchant to do, but not necessarily immediately, use a notification.\nTo confirm success, use feedback for a successful action.\nFor statement of failure, use feedback for unsuccessful action.\nHow to approach sound design\nBe creative and intentional with your sound design. And remember:\nShort sounds should be no longer than 250ms, long sounds no longer than 1 second.\nSounds should be in the same \u201cfamily.\u201d If you introduce a new note, key, or timbre, make sure there\u2019s a good reason.\nCreate two versions of every sound:\nA louder version for desktop applications.\nA quieter version for mobile applications where the speakers are smaller and may distort more easily.\nDesign sounds with as much intentionality as other design aspects of Shopify\u2019s products.",
