A world of seemingly infinite yet unknown possibilities. A world full of ideas, resources and thoughts from people all around the globe. A world waiting for you to be explored.\nIt was mind blowing.\nA magical moment.\nEveryone of us has experienced their own transformative moments with computers. The first time you touched a touchscreen. The first time you wrote and executed a line of code. The first time you discovered a video game that completely consumed you.\nIt\u2019s often difficult to describe these moments because, like magic, they lie beyond articulation. They have to be experienced.\nComputers are not magic in themselves. It\u2019s the software that runs on them, the interaction between bits and atoms, that makes them magical.\nOne ingredient of computer magic is software\u2019s ability to create even more magical experiences. It\u2019s a tool for tools. Great software supports human intellect. But magical software enhances human creativity.\nThe early pioneers of modern computing described computers as \u201cdream machines\u201d. What got them excited about computers was not so much what they were, but everything they had the potential to be.\nThis is the other facet of software magic: It stretches our imagination beyond what we thought was possible. Great software makes us feel like we live in the future. But magical software allows us to imagine the future that comes after it.\nWe look back at these magical moments with nostalgia.\nWhat happened to them?\nPart 02\nThe Present\n(the status quo)\nWe now live in a world where computers have become ubiquitous. They are everywhere, in all shapes and sizes, available to us whenever we need them. We have dream machines at work, at home, and in each of our pockets.\nThe computing capacity of these machines is mind boggling. Even the most audacious cyber-visionaries of the past would not have predicted the power available at our fingertips today.\nAs a result, the world we live in today is shaped and dominated by bits rather than just atoms. Software now touches every arena of human society and more and more aspects of our lives depend on it.\nIt sounds like the future.\nBut it\u2019s not the future we envisioned.\nWhile software is indeed everywhere, truly magical software has become incredibly rare. It was slowly suppressed and pushed away by dark forces.\nEnter the\nvillains of this story.\nDark Force 01\nNoise & Distraction\nThe idea of augmenting our work with the help of software was well intended. But instead of creativity enhancing superpowers, we got attention-seeking productivity silos.\nAlerts\nhere,\nnotifications\nthere. We are spending more time with the coordination of our work than with the work we actually want to get done. Our dream machines are more powerful than ever before, but their output is riddled with noise and distractions.\nDark Force 02\nUniform sameness\nAs competition intensifies, founders rush to get their products out into the market. Product teams literally work in sprints. Craftsmanship was replaced with growth hacks. It\u2019s not just the software itself that lacks personality; has every tech company hired the same illustrator? Our once so lively dreams have become positively lifeless.\nDark Force 03\nThe future is stuck in the past\nA famous quote says that the best way to predict the future is to invent it. Essentially, this is what the magic of software is all about: It lets us paint a vision of the future while simultaneously providing us with the tools to make that future a reality. And yet, ironically, the tools and principles with which we build the future are stuck in the past. The Agile Manifesto was published more than 20 years ago. Its terminology and fundamentals are outdated. But there\u2019s also no definitive methodology that has taken its place.\nWhile we were busy dreaming up visionary ideas we failed to see the dark forces that crept in and clouded our plans. We have arrived at our destination, but it\u2019s not the destination we had in mind. Error 404: Utopian future not found.\nThe magic of software was lost along the way.\nBut not all hope is lost.\nWhat if we can bring it back?\nPart 03\nThe Future\n(the quest we are on)\nIn the not so distant past, a small group of individuals got together and decided to change the status quo. They decided to go on a quest and bring back the\nmagic of software\n.\nThat small group is us.\nWe are the toolmakers in this story.\nEvery great story contains a sacred artifact of great importance. A legendary sword. A secret key. A mystical elixir. A powerful tool without which the battle against evil couldn\u2019t be won.\nOur mission is to create the tool for the story at hand. A tool that feels magical, but more importantly, a tool that grants whoever owns it the ability to create magic.\nThe tool we are building is the fastest of its kind. It is incredibly easy to use, but also grows more powerful with each interaction. And it comes with new and refined methodologies and practices around it to truly unleash its power.\nWe chose to name it\nLinear\nto signify progress.\nTo bring back the magic of software, however, it needs more than just a powerful tool. A powerful tool needs a powerful operator, just like a magical story needs a courageous hero or heroine.\nThe real protagonists of this story are the creators. The designers who invent the dream worlds of tomorrow. The engineers who turn dreams into realities. The entrepreneurs who want to create impact. The ambitious teams who craft software experiences that truly feel magical again.\nIf technology is an expression of humanity\u2019s dreams, then the future of technology is only bound by the limits of our dreams. We need to bring back the magic of software because it is the only way to push the boundaries of our dreams. Because it is the only way to give our dream machines back their real meaning.\nWe are coming to the end of our little tale and you might be wondering where you fit into all of this. After all, wasn\u2019t this story specifically written for you?\nIndeed it was, dear reader.\nWe have reached the end of this page but only the beginning of our real story. And as fortune may have it, you have been elected to partake in its next chapters.\nWho you play in these chapters is for you to decide. You might be an engineer. You might be a designer. You might be a recruiter or a marketer.
