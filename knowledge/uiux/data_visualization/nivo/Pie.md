Generates a pie chart from an array of data, each datum must have an
id and a value property.
Note that margin object does not take radial labels into account,
so you should adjust it to leave enough room for it.

You can also see more example usages in
[the storybook](https://nivo.rocks/storybook/?path=/story/pie--default).

See the [dedicated guide](/guides/legends/) on how to setup
legends for this component.
