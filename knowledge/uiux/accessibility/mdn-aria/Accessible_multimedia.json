Video, audio, and image content need to be given proper textual alternatives so that they can be understood by assistive technologies and their users. This article shows how.\nPrerequisites:\nFamiliarity with\nHTML\n,\nCSS\n, and accessibility best practices as taught in previous lessons in the module..\nLearning outcomes:\nThe issues with native media players, and how to create your custom ones.\nThe purpose of audio transcripts and text tracks (captions, subtitles, etc.) in making audio and video content accessible.\nMultimedia and accessibility\nSo far in this module, we have looked at a variety of content and what needs to be done to ensure its accessibility, ranging from simple text content to data tables, images, native controls such as form elements and buttons, and even more complex markup structures (with\nWAI-ARIA\nattributes).\nThis article on the other hand looks at another general class of content that arguably isn't as easy to ensure accessibility for \u00e2\u0080\u0094 multimedia. Images, audio tracks, videos,\n<canvas>\nelements, etc., aren't as easily understood by screen readers or navigated by the keyboard, and we need to give them a helping hand.\nBut don't despair \u00e2\u0080\u0094 here we will help you navigate through the techniques available for making multimedia more accessible.\nSimple images\nWe already covered simple text alternatives for HTML images in our\nHTML: A good basis for accessibility\narticle \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you can refer back to there for the full details. In short, you should ensure that where possible visual content has an alternative text available for screen readers to pick up and read to their users.\nFor example:\nhtml\n<img\n  src=\"dinosaur.png\"\n  alt=\"A red Tyrannosaurus Rex: A two legged dinosaur standing upright like a human, with small arms, and a large head with lots of sharp teeth.\" />\nAccessible audio and video controls\nImplementing controls for web-based audio/video shouldn't be a problem, right? Let's investigate.\nThe problem with native HTML controls\nHTML video and audio instances even come with a set of inbuilt controls that allow you to control the media straight out of the box. For example (see\nnative-controls.html\nsource code\nand\nlive\n):\nhtml\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"viper.mp3\" type=\"audio/mp3\" />\n  <source src=\"viper.ogg\" type=\"audio/ogg\" />\n  <p>\n    Your browser doesn't support HTML audio. Here is a\n    <a href=\"viper.mp3\">link to the audio</a> instead.\n  </p>\n</audio>\n\n<br />\n\n<video controls>\n  <source src=\"rabbit320.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n  <source src=\"rabbit320.webm\" type=\"video/webm\" />\n  <p>\n    Your browser doesn't support HTML video. Here is a\n    <a href=\"rabbit320.mp4\">link to the video</a> instead.\n  </p>\n</video>\nThe controls attribute provides play/pause buttons, seek bar, etc. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the basic controls you'd expect from a media player. It looks like so in Firefox and Chrome:\nHowever, there are problems with these controls:\nThey are not keyboard-accessible in most browsers, i.e., you can't tab between the controls inside the native player. Opera and Chrome provide this to some degree, but it still isn't ideal.\nDifferent browsers give the native controls differing styling and functionality, and they aren't stylable, meaning that they can't be easily made to follow a site style guide.\nTo remedy this, we can create our own custom controls. Let's look at how.\nCreating custom audio and video controls\nHTML video and audio share an API \u00e2\u0080\u0094 HTML Media Element \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which allows you to map custom functionality to buttons and other controls \u00e2\u0080\u0094 both of which you define yourself.\nLet's take the video example from above and add custom controls to them.\nBasic setup\nFirst, grab a copy of our\ncustom-controls-start.html\n,\ncustom-controls.css\n,\nrabbit320.mp4\n, and\nrabbit320.webm\nfiles and save them in a new directory on your hard drive.\nCreate a new file called main.js and save it in the same directory.\nFirst of all, let's look at the HTML for the video player, in the HTML:\nhtml\n<section class=\"player\">\n  <video controls>\n    <source src=\"rabbit320.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n    <source src=\"rabbit320.webm\" type=\"video/webm\" />\n    <p>\n      Your browser doesn't support HTML video. Here is a\n      <a href=\"rabbit320.mp4\">link to the video</a> instead.\n    </p>\n  </video>\n\n  <div class=\"controls\">\n    <button class=\"play-pause\">Play</button>\n    <button class=\"stop\">Stop</button>\n    <button class=\"rwd\">Rwd</button>\n    <button class=\"fwd\">Fwd</button>\n    <div class=\"time\">00:00</div>\n  </div>\n</section>\nJavaScript basic setup\nWe've inserted some simple control buttons below our video. These controls of course won't do anything by default; to add functionality, we will use JavaScript.\nWe will first need to store references to each of the controls \u00e2\u0080\u0094 add the following to the top of your JavaScript file:\njs\nconst playPauseBtn = document.querySelector(\".play-pause\");\nconst stopBtn = document.querySelector(\".stop\");\nconst rwdBtn = document.querySelector(\".rwd\");\nconst fwdBtn = document.querySelector(\".fwd\");\nconst timeLabel = document.querySelector(\".time\");\nNext, we need to grab a reference to the video/audio player itself \u00e2\u0080\u0094 add this line below the previous lines:\njs\nconst player = document.querySelector(\"video\");\nThis holds a reference to a\nHTMLMediaElement\nobject, which has several useful properties and methods available on it that can be used to wire up functionality to our buttons.\nBefore moving on to creating our button functionality, let's remove the native controls so they don't get in the way of our custom controls. Add the following, again at the bottom of your JavaScript:\njs\nplayer.removeAttribute(\"controls\");\nDoing it this way round rather than just not including the controls attribute in the first place has the advantage that if our JavaScript fails for any reason, the user still has some controls available.\nWiring up our buttons\nFirst, let's set up the play/pause button. We can get this to toggle between play and pause with a simple conditional function, like the following. Add it to your code, at the bottom:\njs\nplayPauseBtn.onclick = () => {\n  if (player.paused) {\n    player.play();\n    playPauseBtn.textContent = \"Pause\";\n  } else {\n    player.pause();\n    playPauseBtn.textContent = \"Play\";\n  }\n};\nNext, add this code to the bottom, which controls the stop button:\njs\nstopBtn.onclick = () => {\n  player.pause();\n  player.currentTime = 0;\n  playPauseBtn.textContent = \"Play\";\n};\nThere is no\nstop()\nfunction available on\nHTMLMediaElement\ns, so instead we\npause()\nit, and at the same time set the\ncurrentTime\nto 0.\nNext, our rewind and fast-forward buttons \u00e2\u0080\u0094 add the following blocks to the bottom of your code:\njs\nrwdBtn.onclick = () => {\n  player.currentTime -= 3;\n};\n\nfwdBtn.onclick = () => {\n  player.currentTime += 3;\n  if (player.currentTime >= player.duration || player.paused) {\n    player.pause();\n    player.currentTime = 0;\n    playPauseBtn.textContent = \"Play\";\n  }\n};\nThese are very simple, just adding or subtracting 3 seconds to the\ncurrentTime\neach time they are clicked. In a real video player, you'd probably want a more elaborate seeking bar, or similar.\nNote that we also check to see if the\ncurrentTime\nis more than the total media\nduration\nor if the media is not playing when the\nfwdBtn\nis pressed. If either condition is true, we stop the video to avoid the user interface going wrong if they attempt to fast forward when the video is not playing or fast forward past the end of the video.\nLast of all, add the following to the end of the code, to control the time elapsed display:\njs\nplayer.ontimeupdate = () => {\n  const minutes = Math.floor(player.currentTime / 60);\n  const seconds = Math.floor(player.currentTime - minutes * 60);\n  const minuteValue = minutes < 10 ? `0${minutes}` : minutes;\n  const secondValue = seconds < 10 ? `0${seconds}` : seconds;\n\n  const mediaTime = `${minuteValue}:${secondValue}`;\n  timeLabel.textContent = mediaTime;\n};\nEach time the time updates (once per second), we fire this function. It works out the number of minutes and seconds from the given currentTime value (which is in seconds), adds a leading 0 if either the minute or second value is less than 10, and then creates the display readout and adds it to the time label.\nFurther reading\nThis gives you a basic idea of how to add custom player functionality to video/audio player instances. For more information on how to add more complex features to video/audio players, see:\nAudio and video delivery\nVideo player styling basics\nCreating a cross-browser video player\nWe've also created an advanced example to show how you could create an object-oriented system that finds every video and audio player on the page (no matter how many there are) and adds our custom controls to it. See\ncustom-controls-oojs\n(also\nsee the source code\n).\nAudio transcripts\nTo provide deaf people with access to audio content, you need to create text transcripts. These can either be included on the same page as the audio in some way or included on a separate page and linked to.\nIn terms of actually creating the transcript, your options are:\nCommercial services \u00e2\u0080\u0094 You could pay a professional to do the transcription, see for example companies like\nScribie\n,\nCasting Words\n, or\nRev\n. Look around and ask for advice to make sure you find a reputable company that you'll be able to work with effectively.\nCommunity/grassroots/self transcription \u00e2\u0080\u0094 If you are part of an active community or team in your workplace, then you could ask them for help with doing the translations. You could even have a go at doing them yourself.\nAutomated services \u00e2\u0080\u0094 There are AI services available, like\nTrint\nor\nTranscribear\n. Upload a video/audio file to the site, and it automatically transcribes it for you. On YouTube, you can choose to generate automated captions/transcripts. Depending on how clear the spoken audio is, the resulting transcript quality will vary greatly.\nAs with most things in life, you tend to get what you pay for; different services will vary in accuracy and time taken to produce the transcript. If you pay a reputable company or AI service to do the transcription, you will probably get it done rapidly and to a high quality. If you don't want to pay for it, you are likely to get it done at a lower quality, and/or slowly.\nIt is not OK to publish an audio resource but promise to publish the transcript later on \u00e2\u0080\u0094 such promises often aren't kept, which will erode trust between you and your users. If the audio you are presenting is something like a face to face meeting or live spoken performance, it would be acceptable to take notes during the performance, publish them in full along with the audio, then seek help in cleaning up the notes afterward.\nTranscript examples\nIf you use an automated service, then you'll probably have to use the user interface that the tool provides. For example, take a look at our\nWait, ARIA Roles Have Categories?\nvideo and choose the three-dot menu (. . .)\n> Show Transcript\n. You'll see the transcript come up in a separate panel.\nIf you are creating your own user interface to present your audio and associated transcript, you can do it however you like, but it might make sense to include it in a showable/hidable panel; see our\naudio-transcript-ui\nexample (also see the\nsource code\n).\nAudio descriptions\nOn occasions where visuals are accompanying your audio, you'll need to provide audio descriptions of some kind to describe that extra content.\nIn many cases, this will take the form of video, in which case you can implement captions using the techniques described in the next section of the article.\nHowever, there are some edge cases. You might for example have an audio recording of a meeting that refers to an accompanying resource such as a spreadsheet or chart. In such cases, you should make sure that the resources are provided along with the audio + transcript, and specifically link to them in the places where they are referred to in the transcript. This of course will help all users, not just people who are deaf.\nNote:\nAn audio transcript will in general help multiple user groups. As well as giving deaf users access to the information contained in the audio, think about a user with a low bandwidth connection, who would find downloading the audio inconvenient. Think also about a user in a noisy environment like a pub or bar, who is trying to access the information but can't hear it over the noise.\nVideo text tracks\nTo make video accessible for the deaf, visually impaired, or other groups of users (such as those on low bandwidth, or who don't understand the language the video is recorded in), you need to include text tracks along with your video content.\nNote:\nText tracks are also useful for potentially any user, not just those with disabilities. For example, some users may not be able to hear the audio because they are in noisy environments (like a crowded bar when a sports game is being shown) or might not want to disturb others if they are in a quiet place (like a library).\nThis is not a new concept \u00e2\u0080\u0094 television services have had closed captioning available for quite a long time:\nMany countries offer English films with subtitles written in their own native languages, and different language subtitles are often available on DVDs, as shown below:\nThere are different types of text tracks for different purposes. The main ones you'll come across are:\nCaptions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 There for the benefit of deaf users who can't hear the audio track, including the words being spoken, and contextual information such as who spoke the words, if the people were angry or sad, and what mood the music is currently creating.\nSubtitles \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Include translations of the audio dialog, for users that don't understand the language being spoken.\nDescriptions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 These include descriptions for visually impaired people who can't see the video, for example, what the scene looks like.\nChapter titles \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Chapter markers intended to help the user navigate the media resource\nImplementing HTML video text tracks\nText tracks for displaying with HTML video need to be written in WebVTT, a text format containing multiple strings of text along with metadata such as what time in the video you want each text string to be displayed, and even limited styling/positioning information. These text strings are called cues.\nA typical WebVTT file will look something like this:\nWEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.606\nThis is the first subtitle.\n\n2\n00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.074\nThis is the second.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nTo get this displayed along with the HTML media playback, you need to:\nSave it as a .vtt file in a sensible place.\nLink to the .vtt file with the\n<track>\nelement.\n<track>\nshould be placed within\n<audio>\nor\n<video>\n, but after all\n<source>\nelements. Use the\nkind\nattribute to specify whether the cues are subtitles, captions, or descriptions. Furthermore, use\nsrclang\nto tell the browser what language you have written the subtitles in.\nHere's an example:\nhtml\n<video controls>\n  <source src=\"example.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n  <source src=\"example.webm\" type=\"video/webm\" />\n  <track kind=\"subtitles\" src=\"subtitles_en.vtt\" srclang=\"en\" />\n</video>\nThis will result in a video that has subtitles displayed. For a full-fledged application and its source code, see\nAdding captions and subtitles to HTML video\n. This example uses JavaScript to allow users to choose between different subtitles. Note that to turn the subtitles on, you need to press the \"CC\" button and select an option \u00e2\u0080\u0094 English, Deutsch, or Espa\u00c3\u00b1ol.\nNote:\nText tracks and transcriptions also help you with\nSEO\n, since search engines especially thrive on text. Text tracks even allow search engines to link directly to a spot partway through the video.\nSummary\nThis chapter has provided a summary of accessibility concerns for multimedia content, along with some practical solutions.\nIt is not always easy to make multimedia accessible. If for example, you are dealing with an immersive 3D game or virtual reality app, it is quite difficult to provide text alternatives for such an experience, and you might argue that visually impaired users are not really in the target audience bracket for such apps.\nYou can however make sure that such an app has good enough color contrast and clear presentation so it is perceivable to those with low vision/color blindness, and also make it keyboard accessible. Remember that accessibility is about doing as much as you can, rather than striving for 100% accessibility all the time, which is often impossible.\nPrevious\nOverview: Accessibility on the web\nNext\nHelp improve MDN\nLearn how to contribute\nThis page was last modified on\nSep 2, 2025\nby\nMDN contributors\n.\nView this page on GitHub\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\nReport a problem with this content",

See [custom-controls-oojs](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/multimedia/custom-controls-OOJS/) (also [see the source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/main/accessibility/multimedia/custom-controls-OOJS)).\n\n## [Audio transcripts](#audio_transcripts)\n\nTo provide deaf people with access to audio content, you need to create text transcripts. These can either be included on the same page as the audio in some way or included on a separate page and linked to.\n\nIn terms of actually creating the transcript, your options are:\n\n- Commercial services \u00e2\u0080\u0094 You could pay a professional to do the transcription, see for example companies like [Scribie](https://scribie.com/), [Casting Words](https://castingwords.com/), or [Rev](https://www.rev.com/). Look around and ask for advice to make sure you find a reputable company that you'll be able to work with effectively.\n- Community/grassroots/self transcription \u00e2\u0080\u0094 If you are part of an active community or team in your workplace, then you could ask them for help with doing the translations. You could even have a go at doing them yourself.\n- Automated services \u00e2\u0080\u0094 There are AI services available, like [Trint](https://trint.com/) or [Transcribear](https://transcribear.com/). Upload a video/audio file to the site, and it automatically transcribes it for you. On YouTube, you can choose to generate automated captions/transcripts. Depending on how clear the spoken audio is, the resulting transcript quality will vary greatly.\n\nAs with most things in life, you tend to get what you pay for; different services will vary in accuracy and time taken to produce the transcript. If you pay a reputable company or AI service to do the transcription, you will probably get it done rapidly and to a high quality. If you don't want to pay for it, you are likely to get it done at a lower quality, and/or slowly.\n\nIt is not OK to publish an audio resource but promise to publish the transcript later on \u00e2\u0080\u0094 such promises often aren't kept, which will erode trust between you and your users. If the audio you are presenting is something like a face to face meeting or live spoken performance, it would be acceptable to take notes during the performance, publish them in full along with the audio, then seek help in cleaning up the notes afterward.\n\n### [Transcript examples](#transcript_examples)\n\nIf you use an automated service, then you'll probably have to use the user interface that the tool provides. For example, take a look at our [Wait, ARIA Roles Have Categories?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwF-PpJOjMs) video and choose the three-dot menu (. . .) *> Show Transcript*. You'll see the transcript come up in a separate panel.\n\nIf you are creating your own user interface to present your audio and associated transcript, you can do it however you like, but it might make sense to include it in a showable/hidable panel; see our [audio-transcript-ui](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/multimedia/audio-transcript-ui/) example (also see the [source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/main/accessibility/multimedia/audio-transcript-ui)).\n\n### [Audio descriptions](#audio_descriptions)\n\nOn occasions where visuals are accompanying your audio, you'll need to provide audio descriptions of some kind to describe that extra content.\n\nIn many cases, this will take the form of video, in which case you can implement captions using the techniques described in the next section of the article.\n\nHowever, there are some edge cases. You might for example have an audio recording of a meeting that refers to an accompanying resource such as a spreadsheet or chart. In such cases, you should make sure that the resources are provided along with the audio + transcript, and specifically link to them in the places where they are referred to in the transcript. This of course will help all users, not just people who are deaf.\n\n**Note:**\nAn audio transcript will in general help multiple user groups. As well as giving deaf users access to the information contained in the audio, think about a user with a low bandwidth connection, who would find downloading the audio inconvenient. Think also about a user in a noisy environment like a pub or bar, who is trying to access the information but can't hear it over the noise.\n\n## [Video text tracks](#video_text_tracks)\n\nTo make video accessible for the deaf, visually impaired, or other groups of users (such as those on low bandwidth, or who don't understand the language the video is recorded in), you need to include text tracks along with your video content.\n\n**Note:**\nText tracks are also useful for potentially any user, not just those with disabilities. For example, some users may not be able to hear the audio because they are in noisy environments (like a crowded bar when a sports game is being shown) or might not want to disturb others if they are in a quiet place (like a library).\n\nThis is not a new concept \u00e2\u0080\u0094 television services have had closed captioning available for quite a long time:\n\n![Frame from an old-timey cartoon with closed captioning \"Good work, Goldie. Keep it up!\"](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/Multimedia/closed-captions.png)\n\nMany countries offer English films with subtitles written in their own native languages, and different language subtitles are often available on DVDs, as shown below:\n\n![An English film with German subtitles \"Emo, warum erkennst du nicht die Schonheit dieses Ortes?\"](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/Multimedia/subtitles_german.png)\n\nThere are different types of text tracks for different purposes. The main ones you'll come across are:\n\n- Captions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 There for the benefit of deaf users who can't hear the audio track, including the words being spoken, and contextual information such as who spoke the words, if the people were angry or sad, and what mood the music is currently creating.\n- Subtitles \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Include translations of the audio dialog, for users that don't understand the language being spoken.\n- Descriptions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 These include descriptions for visually impaired people who can't see the video, for example, what the scene looks like.\n- Chapter titles \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Chapter markers intended to help the user navigate the media resource\n\n### [Implementing HTML video text tracks](#implementing_html_video_text_tracks)\n\nText tracks for displaying with HTML video need to be written in WebVTT, a text format containing multiple strings of text along with metadata such as what time in the video you want each text string to be displayed, and even limited styling/positioning information. These text strings are called cues.\n\nA typical WebVTT file will look something like this:\n\n```\nWEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.606\nThis is the first subtitle.\n\n2\n00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.074\nThis is the second.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n```\n\nTo get this displayed along with the HTML media playback, you need to:\n\n- Save it as a .vtt file in a sensible place.\n- Link to the .vtt file with the [`<track>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/track) element. `<track>` should be placed within `<audio>` or `<video>`, but after all `<source>` elements. Use the [`kind`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/track#kind) attribute to specify whether the cues are subtitles, captions, or descriptions. Furthermore, use [`srclang`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/track#srclang) to tell the browser what language you have written the subtitles in.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nhtml\n\n```\n<video controls>\n  <source src=\"example.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n  <source src=\"example.webm\" type=\"video/webm\" />\n  <track kind=\"subtitles\" src=\"subtitles_en.vtt\" srclang=\"en\" />\n</video>\n```\n\nThis will result in a video that has subtitles displayed. For a full-fledged application and its source code, see [Adding captions and subtitles to HTML video](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Audio_and_video_delivery/Adding_captions_and_subtitles_to_HTML5_video). This example uses JavaScript to allow users to choose between different subtitles. Note that to turn the subtitles on, you need to press the \"CC\" button and select an option \u00e2\u0080\u0094 English, Deutsch, or Espa\u00c3\u00b1ol.\n\n**Note:**\nText tracks and transcriptions also help you with [SEO](/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO), since search engines especially thrive on text. Text tracks even allow search engines to link directly to a spot partway through the video.\n\n## [Summary](#summary)\n\nThis chapter has provided a summary of accessibility concerns for multimedia content, along with some practical solutions.\n\nIt is not always easy to make multimedia accessible. If for example, you are dealing with an immersive 3D game or virtual reality app, it is quite difficult to provide text alternatives for such an experience, and you might argue that visually impaired users are not really in the target audience bracket for such apps.\n\nYou can however make sure that such an app has good enough color contrast and clear presentation so it is perceivable to those with low vision/color blindness, and also make it keyboard accessible. Remember that accessibility is about doing as much as you can, rather than striving for 100% accessibility all the time, which is often impossible.\n\n- [Previous](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/Test_your_skills/WAI-ARIA)\n- [Overview: Accessibility on the web](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility)\n- [Next](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/Mobile)\n\n## Help improve MDN\n\nWas this page helpful to you?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\n[Learn how to contribute](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Getting_started)\n\nThis page was last modified on Sep 2, 2025 by [MDN contributors](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/Multimedia/contributors.txt).\n\n[View this page on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/learn_web_development/core/accessibility/multimedia/index.md?plain=1 \"Folder: en-us/learn_web_development/core/accessibility/multimedia (Opens in a new tab)\") \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 [Report a problem with this content](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/new?template=page-report.yml&mdn-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FLearn_web_development%2FCore%2FAccessibility%2FMultimedia&metadata=%3C%21--+Do+not+make+changes+below+this+line+--%3E%0A%3Cdetails%3E%0A%3Csummary%3EPage+report+details%3C%2Fsummary%3E%0A%0A*+Folder%3A+%60en-us%2Flearn_web_development%2Fcore%2Faccessibility%2Fmultimedia%60%0A*+MDN+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FLearn_web_development%2FCore%2FAccessibility%2FMultimedia%0A*+GitHub+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Ffiles%2Fen-us%2Flearn_web_development%2Fcore%2Faccessibility%2Fmultimedia%2Findex.md%0A*+Last+commit%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fcommit%2Fdaad50a992d56b23573fdd50517c75df176747cf%0A*+Document+last+modified%3A+2025-09-02T15%3A43%3A09.000Z%0A%0A%3C%2Fdetails%3E \"This will take you to GitHub to file a new issue.\")",
