This article looks at mobile-specific accessibility considerations.\nPrerequisites:\nFamiliarity with\nHTML\n,\nCSS\n, and accessibility best practices as taught in previous lessons in the module..\nLearning outcomes:\nFamiliarity with screen readers on iOS and Android.\nFamiliarity with accessibility issues behind some types of events.\nSpecific techniques for more usable user input mechanisms on mobile.\nKnow that mobile browsers provide specific usability advantages for specific\n<input>\ntypes such as\nnumber\nor\ntel\n.\nAccessibility on mobile devices\nThe state of accessibility \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and support for web standards in general \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is good in modern mobile devices. Long gone are the days when mobile devices ran completely different web technologies to desktop browsers, forcing developers to use browser sniffing and serve them completely separate sites (although quite a few companies still detect usage of mobile devices and serve them a separate mobile domain).\nThese days, mobile devices can usually handle fully-featured websites, and the main platforms even have screen readers built in to enable visually impaired users to use them successfully. Modern mobile browsers tend to have good support for\nWAI-ARIA\n, too.\nTo make a website accessible and usable on mobile, you just need to follow general good web design and accessibility best practices.\nThere are some exceptions that need special consideration for mobile; the main ones are:\nControl mechanisms \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Make sure interface controls such as buttons are accessible on mobiles (i.e., mainly touchscreen), as well as desktops/laptops (mainly mouse/keyboard).\nUser input \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Make user input requirements as painless as possible on mobile (e.g., in forms, keep typing to a minimum).\nResponsive design \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Make sure layouts work on mobile, conserve image download sizes, and think about the provision of images for high-resolution screens.\nSummary of screen reader testing on Android and iOS\nThe most common mobile platforms have fully functional screen readers. These function in much the same way as desktop screen readers, except they are largely operated using touch gestures rather than key combinations.\nLet's look at the main two: TalkBack on Android and VoiceOver on iOS.\nAndroid TalkBack\nThe TalkBack screen reader is built into the Android operating system.\nTo turn it on, look up what phone model and Android version you have, and then look up where the TalkBack menu is. It tends to differ widely between Android versions and even between different phone models. Some phone manufacturers (e.g., Samsung) don't even have TalkBack in newer phones, and instead opted for their own screen reader.\nWhen you've found the TalkBack menu, press the slider switch to turn TalkBack on. Follow any additional on-screen prompts that you are presented with.\nWhen TalkBack is turned on, your Android device's basic controls will be a bit different. For example:\nSingle-tapping an app will select it, and the device will read out what the app is.\nSwiping left and right will move between apps, or buttons/controls if you are in a control bar. The device will read out each option.\nDouble-tapping anywhere will open the app/select the option.\nYou can also \"explore by touch\" \u00e2\u0080\u0094 hold your finger down on the screen and drag it around, and your device will read out the different apps/items you move across.\nIf you want to turn TalkBack off:\nNavigate back to the TalkBack menu screen (using the different gestures that are currently enabled.)\nNavigate to the slider switch and activate it to turn it off.\nNote:\nYou can get to your home screen at any time by swiping up and left in a smooth motion. If you have more than one home screen, you can move between them by swiping two fingers left and right.\nFor a more complete list of TalkBack gestures, see\nUse TalkBack gestures\n.\nUnlocking the phone\nWhen TalkBack is turned on, unlocking the phone is a bit different.\nYou can do a two-finger swipe up from the bottom of the lock screen. If you've set a passcode or pattern for unlocking your device, you will then be taken to the relevant entry screen to enter it.\nYou can also explore by touch to find the\nUnlock\nbutton at the bottom middle of the screen, and then double-tap.\nGlobal and local menus\nTalkBack allows you to access global and local context menus, wherever you have navigated on the device. The former provides global options relating to the device as a whole, and the latter provides options relating just to the current app/screen you are in.\nTo get to these menus:\nAccess the global menu by quickly swiping down, and then right.\nAccess the local menu by quickly swiping up, and then right.\nSwipe left and right to cycle between the different options.\nOnce you've selected the option you want, double-tap to choose that option.\nFor details on all the options available under the global and local context menus, see\nUse global and local context menus\n.\nBrowsing web pages\nYou can use the local context menu while in a web browser to find options to navigate web pages using just the headings, form controls, or links, or navigate line by line, etc.\nFor example, with TalkBack turned on:\nOpen your web browser.\nActivate the URL bar.\nEnter a web page that has a bunch of headings on it, such as the front page of bbc.co.uk. To enter the text of the URL:\nSelect the URL bar by swiping left/right till you get to it, and then double-tapping.\nHold your finger down on the virtual keyboard until you get the character you want, and then release your finger to type it. Repeat for each character.\nOnce you've finished, find the Enter key and press it.\nSwipe left and right to move between different items on the page.\nSwipe up and right with a smooth motion to enter the local content menu.\nSwipe right until you find the \"Headings and Landmarks\" option.\nDouble-tap to select it. Now you'll be able to swipe left and right to move between headings and ARIA landmarks.\nTo go back to the default mode, enter the local context menu again by swiping up and right, select \"Default\", and then double-tap to activate.\nNote:\nSee\nGet started on Android with TalkBack\nfor more complete documentation.\niOS VoiceOver\nA mobile version of VoiceOver is built into the iOS operating system.\nTo turn it on, go to Your\nSettings\napp and select\nAccessibility > VoiceOver\n. Press the\nVoiceOver\nslider to enable it (you'll also see several other options related to VoiceOver on this page).\nNote:\nSome older iOS devices have the VoiceOver menu at\nSettings app\n>\nGeneral\n>\nAccessibility\n>\nVoiceOver\n.\nOnce VoiceOver is enabled, iOS's basic control gestures will be a bit different:\nA single tap will cause the item you tap on to be selected; your device will speak the item you've tapped on.\nYou can also navigate the items on the screen by swiping left and right to move between them, or by sliding your finger around on the screen to move between different items (when you find the item you want, you can remove your finger to select it).\nTo activate the selected item (e.g., open a selected app), double-tap anywhere on the screen.\nSwipe with three fingers to scroll through a page.\nTap with two fingers to perform a context-relevant action \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for example, taking a photo while in the camera app.\nTo turn it off again, navigate back to\nSettings > General > Accessibility > VoiceOver\nusing the above gestures, and toggle the\nVoiceOver\nslider back to off.\nUnlock phone\nTo unlock the phone, you need to press the home button (or swipe) as normal. If you have a passcode set, you can select each number by swiping/sliding (as explained above) and then double-tapping to enter each number when you've found the right one.\nUsing the Rotor\nWhen VoiceOver is turned on, you have a navigation feature called the Rotor available to you, which allows you to quickly choose from a number of common useful options. To use it:\nTwist two fingers around on the screen like you are turning a dial. Each option will be read aloud as you twist further around. You can go back and forth to cycle through the options.\nOnce you've found the option you want:\nRelease your fingers to select it.\nIf it is an option you can iterate the value of (such as Volume or Speaking Rate), you can do a swipe up or down to increase or decrease the value of the selected item.\nThe options available under the Rotor are context-sensitive \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they will differ depending on what app or view you are in (see below for an example).\nBrowsing web pages\nLet's have a go at web browsing with VoiceOver:\nOpen your web browser.\nActivate the URL bar.\nEnter a web page that has a bunch of headings on it, such as the front page of bbc.co.uk. To enter the text of the URL:\nSelect the URL bar by swiping left/right until you get to it, and then double-tapping.\nFor each character, hold your finger down on the virtual keyboard until you get the character you want, and then release your finger to select it. Double-tap to type it.\nOnce you've finished, find the Enter key and press it.\nSwipe left and right to move between items on the page. You can double-tap an item to select it (e.g., follow a link).\nBy default, the selected Rotor option will be Speaking Rate; you can currently swipe up and down to increase or decrease the speaking rate.\nNow turn two fingers around the screen like a dial to show the rotor and move between its options. Here are a few examples of the options available:\nSpeaking Rate\n: Change the speaking rate.\nContainers\n: Move between different semantic containers on the page.\nHeadings\n: Move between headings on the page.\nLinks\n: Move between links on the page.\nForm Controls\n: Move between form controls on the page.\nLanguage\n: Move between different translations, if they are available.\nSelect\nHeadings\n. Now you'll be able to swipe up and down to move between headings on the page.\nNote:\nFor a more complete reference covering the VoiceOver gestures available and other hints on accessibility testing on iOS, see\nApple's VoiceOver documentation\n.\nControl mechanisms\nIn our CSS and JavaScript accessibility article, we looked at the idea of events that are specific to a certain type of control mechanism (see\nMouse-specific events\n). To recap, these cause accessibility issues because other control mechanisms can't activate the associated functionality.\nAs an example, the\nclick\nevent is good in terms of accessibility \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an associated event handler can be invoked by clicking the element the handler is set on, tabbing to it and pressing Enter/Return, or tapping it on a touchscreen device. Try our\nsimple-button-example.html\nexample (\nsee it running live\n) to see what we mean.\nAlternatively, mouse-specific events such as\nmousedown\nand\nmouseup\ncreate problems \u00e2\u0080\u0094 their event handlers cannot be invoked using non-mouse controls.\nIf you try to control our\nsimple-box-drag.html\n(\nsee example live\n) example with a keyboard or touch, you'll see the problem. This occurs because we are using code such as the following:\njs\ndiv.onmousedown = () => {\n  initialBoxX = div.offsetLeft;\n  initialBoxY = div.offsetTop;\n  movePanel();\n};\n\ndocument.onmouseup = stopMove;\nTo enable other forms of control, you need to use different, yet equivalent events \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for example, touch events work on touchscreen devices:\njs\ndiv.ontouchstart = (e) => {\n  initialBoxX = div.offsetLeft;\n  initialBoxY = div.offsetTop;\n  positionHandler(e);\n  movePanel();\n};\n\npanel.ontouchend = stopMove;\nWe've provided a simple example that shows how to use the mouse and touch events together \u00e2\u0080\u0094 see\nmulti-control-box-drag.html\n(\nsee the example live\nalso).\nNote:\nYou can also see fully functional examples showing how to implement different control mechanisms at\nImplementing game control mechanisms\n.\nResponsive design\nResponsive design\nis the practice of making your layouts and other features of your apps dynamically change depending on factors such as screen size and resolution, so they are usable and accessible to users of different device types.\nIn particular, the most common problems that need to be addressed for mobile are:\nSuitability of layouts for mobile devices. A multi-column layout won't work as well on a narrow screen, for example, and the text size may need to be increased so it is legible. Such issues can be solved by creating a responsive layout using technologies such as\nmedia queries\n,\nviewport\n, and\nflexbox\n.\nConserving image sizes downloaded. In general, small-screen devices won't need images that are as large as their desktop counterparts, and they are more likely to be on slow network connections. Therefore, it is wise to serve smaller images to narrow screen devices as appropriate. You can handle this using\nresponsive image techniques\n.\nThinking about high resolutions. Many mobile devices have high-resolution screens, and therefore need higher-resolution images so that the display can continue to look crisp and sharp. Again, you can serve images as appropriate using responsive image techniques. In addition, many image requirements can be fulfilled using the SVG vector images format, which is well-supported across browsers today. SVG has a small file size and will stay sharp regardless of whatever size is being displayed (see\nIncluding vector graphics in HTML\nfor more details).\nNote:\nWe won't provide a full discussion of responsive design techniques here, as they are covered in other places around MDN (see the above links).\nSpecific mobile considerations\nThere are other important issues to consider when making sites more accessible on mobile. We have listed a couple here, but we will add more when we think of them.\nNot disabling zoom\nUsing\nviewport\n, it is possible to disable zoom. Always ensure resizing is enabled, and set the width to the device's width in the\n<head>\n:\nhtml\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width; user-scalable=yes\" />\nYou should never set\nuser-scalable=no\nif at all possible \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many people rely on zoom to be able to see the content of your website, so taking this functionality away is a really bad idea. There are certain situations where zooming might break the UI; in such cases, if you feel that you need to disable zoom, you should provide some other kind of equivalent, such as a control for increasing the text size in a way that doesn't break your UI.\nKeeping menus accessible\nBecause the screen is so much narrower on mobile devices, it is very common to use media queries and other technologies to make the navigation menu shrink down to a tiny icon at the top of the display \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which can be pressed to reveal the menu only if it's needed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 when the site is viewed on mobile. This is commonly represented by a \"three horizontal lines\" icon, and the design pattern is consequently known as a \"hamburger menu\".\nWhen implementing such a menu, you need to make sure that the control to reveal it is accessible by appropriate control mechanisms (normally touch for mobile), as discussed in\nControl mechanisms\nabove, and that the rest of the page is moved out of the way or hidden in some way while the menu is being accessed, to avoid confusion with navigating it.\nClick here for a\ngood hamburger menu example\n.\nUser input\nOn mobile devices, inputting data tends to be more annoying for users than the equivalent experience on desktop computers. It is more convenient to type text into form inputs using a desktop or laptop keyboard than a touchscreen virtual keyboard or a tiny mobile physical keyboard.\nFor this reason, it is worth trying to minimize the amount of typing needed. As an example, instead of getting users to fill out their job title each time using a regular text input, you could instead offer a\n<select>\nmenu containing the most common options (which also helps with consistency in data entry) and offer an \"Other\" option that displays a text field to type any outliers into. You can see a simple example of this idea in action in\ncommon-job-types.html\n(see the\ncommon jobs example live\n).\nIt is also worth considering the use of HTML form input types such as the date on mobile platforms as they handle them well \u00e2\u0080\u0094 both Android and iOS, for example, display usable widgets that fit well with the device experience. See\nhtml5-form-examples.html\nfor some examples (see the\nHTML5 form examples live\n) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 try loading these and manipulating them on mobile devices. For example:\nTypes\nnumber\n,\ntel\n, and\nemail\ndisplay suitable virtual keyboards for entering numbers/telephone numbers.\nTypes\ntime\nand\ndate\ndisplay suitable pickers for selecting times and dates.\nIf you want to provide a different solution for desktops, you could always serve different markup to your mobile devices using feature detection. Check out our\nfeature detection article\nfor more information.\nSummary\nIn this article, we have provided you with some details about common mobile accessibility-specific issues and how to overcome them. We also took you through the usage of the most common screen readers to aid you in accessibility testing.\nSee also\nGuidelines For Mobile Web Development\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 A list of articles in\nSmashing Magazine\ncovering different techniques for mobile web design.\nMake your site work on touch devices\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Useful article about using touch events to get interactions working on mobile devices.\nPrevious\nOverview: Accessibility on the web\nNext\nHelp improve MDN\nLearn how to contribute\nThis page was last modified on\nNov 7, 2025\nby\nMDN contributors\n.\nView this page on GitHub\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\nReport a problem with this content",

These function in much the same way as desktop screen readers, except they are largely operated using touch gestures rather than key combinations.\n\nLet's look at the main two: TalkBack on Android and VoiceOver on iOS.\n\n### [Android TalkBack](#android_talkback)\n\nThe TalkBack screen reader is built into the Android operating system.\n\nTo turn it on, look up what phone model and Android version you have, and then look up where the TalkBack menu is. It tends to differ widely between Android versions and even between different phone models. Some phone manufacturers (e.g., Samsung) don't even have TalkBack in newer phones, and instead opted for their own screen reader.\n\nWhen you've found the TalkBack menu, press the slider switch to turn TalkBack on. Follow any additional on-screen prompts that you are presented with.\n\nWhen TalkBack is turned on, your Android device's basic controls will be a bit different. For example:\n\n1. Single-tapping an app will select it, and the device will read out what the app is.\n2. Swiping left and right will move between apps, or buttons/controls if you are in a control bar. The device will read out each option.\n3. Double-tapping anywhere will open the app/select the option.\n4. You can also \"explore by touch\" \u00e2\u0080\u0094 hold your finger down on the screen and drag it around, and your device will read out the different apps/items you move across.\n\nIf you want to turn TalkBack off:\n\n1. Navigate back to the TalkBack menu screen (using the different gestures that are currently enabled.)\n2. Navigate to the slider switch and activate it to turn it off.\n\n**Note:**\nYou can get to your home screen at any time by swiping up and left in a smooth motion. If you have more than one home screen, you can move between them by swiping two fingers left and right.\n\nFor a more complete list of TalkBack gestures, see [Use TalkBack gestures](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6151827).\n\n#### Unlocking the phone\n\nWhen TalkBack is turned on, unlocking the phone is a bit different.\n\nYou can do a two-finger swipe up from the bottom of the lock screen. If you've set a passcode or pattern for unlocking your device, you will then be taken to the relevant entry screen to enter it.\n\nYou can also explore by touch to find the *Unlock* button at the bottom middle of the screen, and then double-tap.\n\n#### Global and local menus\n\nTalkBack allows you to access global and local context menus, wherever you have navigated on the device. The former provides global options relating to the device as a whole, and the latter provides options relating just to the current app/screen you are in.\n\nTo get to these menus:\n\n1. Access the global menu by quickly swiping down, and then right.\n2. Access the local menu by quickly swiping up, and then right.\n3. Swipe left and right to cycle between the different options.\n4. Once you've selected the option you want, double-tap to choose that option.\n\nFor details on all the options available under the global and local context menus, see [Use global and local context menus](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6007066).\n\n#### Browsing web pages\n\nYou can use the local context menu while in a web browser to find options to navigate web pages using just the headings, form controls, or links, or navigate line by line, etc.\n\nFor example, with TalkBack turned on:\n\n1. Open your web browser.\n2. Activate the URL bar.\n3. Enter a web page that has a bunch of headings on it, such as the front page of bbc.co.uk. To enter the text of the URL:\n\n   - Select the URL bar by swiping left/right till you get to it, and then double-tapping.\n   - Hold your finger down on the virtual keyboard until you get the character you want, and then release your finger to type it. Repeat for each character.\n   - Once you've finished, find the Enter key and press it.\n4. Swipe left and right to move between different items on the page.\n5. Swipe up and right with a smooth motion to enter the local content menu.\n6. Swipe right until you find the \"Headings and Landmarks\" option.\n7. Double-tap to select it. Now you'll be able to swipe left and right to move between headings and ARIA landmarks.\n8. To go back to the default mode, enter the local context menu again by swiping up and right, select \"Default\", and then double-tap to activate.\n\n**Note:**\nSee [Get started on Android with TalkBack](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6283677?hl=en&ref_topic=3529932) for more complete documentation.\n\n### [iOS VoiceOver](#ios_voiceover)\n\nA mobile version of VoiceOver is built into the iOS operating system.\n\nTo turn it on, go to Your *Settings* app and select *Accessibility > VoiceOver*. Press the *VoiceOver* slider to enable it (you'll also see several other options related to VoiceOver on this page).\n\n**Note:**\nSome older iOS devices have the VoiceOver menu at *Settings app* > *General* > *Accessibility* > *VoiceOver*.\n\nOnce VoiceOver is enabled, iOS's basic control gestures will be a bit different:\n\n1. A single tap will cause the item you tap on to be selected; your device will speak the item you've tapped on.\n2. You can also navigate the items on the screen by swiping left and right to move between them, or by sliding your finger around on the screen to move between different items (when you find the item you want, you can remove your finger to select it).\n3. To activate the selected item (e.g., open a selected app), double-tap anywhere on the screen.\n4. Swipe with three fingers to scroll through a page.\n5. Tap with two fingers to perform a context-relevant action \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for example, taking a photo while in the camera app.\n\nTo turn it off again, navigate back to *Settings > General > Accessibility > VoiceOver* using the above gestures, and toggle the *VoiceOver* slider back to off.\n\n#### Unlock phone\n\nTo unlock the phone, you need to press the home button (or swipe) as normal. If you have a passcode set, you can select each number by swiping/sliding (as explained above) and then double-tapping to enter each number when you've found the right one.\n\n#### Using the Rotor\n\nWhen VoiceOver is turned on, you have a navigation feature called the Rotor available to you, which allows you to quickly choose from a number of common useful options. To use it:\n\n1. Twist two fingers around on the screen like you are turning a dial. Each option will be read aloud as you twist further around. You can go back and forth to cycle through the options.\n2. Once you've found the option you want:\n   - Release your fingers to select it.\n   - If it is an option you can iterate the value of (such as Volume or Speaking Rate), you can do a swipe up or down to increase or decrease the value of the selected item.\n\nThe options available under the Rotor are context-sensitive \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they will differ depending on what app or view you are in (see below for an example).\n\n#### Browsing web pages\n\nLet's have a go at web browsing with VoiceOver:\n\n1. Open your web browser.\n2. Activate the URL bar.\n3. Enter a web page that has a bunch of headings on it, such as the front page of bbc.co.uk. To enter the text of the URL:\n\n   - Select the URL bar by swiping left/right until you get to it, and then double-tapping.\n   - For each character, hold your finger down on the virtual keyboard until you get the character you want, and then release your finger to select it. Double-tap to type it.\n   - Once you've finished, find the Enter key and press it.\n4. Swipe left and right to move between items on the page. You can double-tap an item to select it (e.g., follow a link).\n5. By default, the selected Rotor option will be Speaking Rate; you can currently swipe up and down to increase or decrease the speaking rate.\n6. Now turn two fingers around the screen like a dial to show the rotor and move between its options. Here are a few examples of the options available:\n\n   - *Speaking Rate*: Change the speaking rate.\n   - *Containers*: Move between different semantic containers on the page.\n   - *Headings*: Move between headings on the page.\n   - *Links*: Move between links on the page.\n   - *Form Controls*: Move between form controls on the page.\n   - *Language*: Move between different translations, if they are available.\n7. Select *Headings*. Now you'll be able to swipe up and down to move between headings on the page.\n\n**Note:**\nFor a more complete reference covering the VoiceOver gestures available and other hints on accessibility testing on iOS, see [Apple's VoiceOver documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accessibility/voiceover/).\n\n## [Control mechanisms](#control_mechanisms)\n\nIn our CSS and JavaScript accessibility article, we looked at the idea of events that are specific to a certain type of control mechanism (see [Mouse-specific events](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/CSS_and_JavaScript#mouse-specific_events)). To recap, these cause accessibility issues because other control mechanisms can't activate the associated functionality.\n\nAs an example, the [click](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event) event is good in terms of accessibility \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an associated event handler can be invoked by clicking the element the handler is set on, tabbing to it and pressing Enter/Return, or tapping it on a touchscreen device. Try our [simple-button-example.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/accessibility/mobile/simple-button-example.html) example ([see it running live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/mobile/simple-button-example.html)) to see what we mean.\n\nAlternatively, mouse-specific events such as [mousedown](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mousedown_event) and [mouseup](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mouseup_event) create problems \u00e2\u0080\u0094 their event handlers cannot be invoked using non-mouse controls.\n\nIf you try to control our [simple-box-drag.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/accessibility/mobile/simple-box-drag.html) ([see example live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/mobile/simple-box-drag.html)) example with a keyboard or touch, you'll see the problem. This occurs because we are using code such as the following:\n\njs\n\n```\ndiv.onmousedown = () => {\n  initialBoxX = div.offsetLeft;\n  initialBoxY = div.offsetTop;\n  movePanel();\n};\n\ndocument.onmouseup = stopMove;\n```\n\nTo enable other forms of control, you need to use different, yet equivalent events \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for example, touch events work on touchscreen devices:\n\njs\n\n```\ndiv.ontouchstart = (e) => {\n  initialBoxX = div.offsetLeft;\n  initialBoxY = div.offsetTop;\n  positionHandler(e);\n  movePanel();\n};\n\npanel.ontouchend = stopMove;\n```\n\nWe've provided a simple example that shows how to use the mouse and touch events together \u00e2\u0080\u0094 see [multi-control-box-drag.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/accessibility/mobile/multi-control-box-drag.html) ([see the example live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/mobile/multi-control-box-drag.html) also).\n\n**Note:**\nYou can also see fully functional examples showing how to implement different control mechanisms at [Implementing game control mechanisms](/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/Control_mechanisms).\n\n## [Responsive design](#responsive_design)\n\n[Responsive design](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design) is the practice of making your layouts and other features of your apps dynamically change depending on factors such as screen size and resolution, so they are usable and accessible to users of different device types.\n\nIn particular, the most common problems that need to be addressed for mobile are:\n\n- Suitability of layouts for mobile devices. A multi-column layout won't work as well on a narrow screen, for example, and the text size may need to be increased so it is legible. Such issues can be solved by creating a responsive layout using technologies such as [media queries](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Guides/Media_queries), [viewport](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name/viewport), and [flexbox](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Flexbox).\n- Conserving image sizes downloaded. In general, small-screen devices won't need images that are as large as their desktop counterparts, and they are more likely to be on slow network connections. Therefore, it is wise to serve smaller images to narrow screen devices as appropriate. You can handle this using [responsive image techniques](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Responsive_images).\n- Thinking about high resolutions. Many mobile devices have high-resolution screens, and therefore need higher-resolution images so that the display can continue to look crisp and sharp. Again, you can serve images as appropriate using responsive image techniques. In addition, many image requirements can be fulfilled using the SVG vector images format, which is well-supported across browsers today. SVG has a small file size and will stay sharp regardless of whatever size is being displayed (see [Including vector graphics in HTML](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Including_vector_graphics_in_HTML) for more details).\n\n**Note:**\nWe won't provide a full discussion of responsive design techniques here, as they are covered in other places around MDN (see the above links).\n\n### [Specific mobile considerations](#specific_mobile_considerations)\n\nThere are other important issues to consider when making sites more accessible on mobile. We have listed a couple here, but we will add more when we think of them.\n\n#### Not disabling zoom\n\nUsing [viewport](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name/viewport), it is possible to disable zoom. Always ensure resizing is enabled, and set the width to the device's width in the [`<head>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/head):\n\nhtml\n\n```\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width; user-scalable=yes\" />\n```\n\nYou should never set `user-scalable=no` if at all possible \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many people rely on zoom to be able to see the content of your website, so taking this functionality away is a really bad idea. There are certain situations where zooming might break the UI; in such cases, if you feel that you need to disable zoom, you should provide some other kind of equivalent, such as a control for increasing the text size in a way that doesn't break your UI.\n\n#### Keeping menus accessible\n\nBecause the screen is so much narrower on mobile devices, it is very common to use media queries and other technologies to make the navigation menu shrink down to a tiny icon at the top of the display \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which can be pressed to reveal the menu only if it's needed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 when the site is viewed on mobile. This is commonly represented by a \"three horizontal lines\" icon, and the design pattern is consequently known as a \"hamburger menu\".\n\nWhen implementing such a menu, you need to make sure that the control to reveal it is accessible by appropriate control mechanisms (normally touch for mobile), as discussed in [Control mechanisms](#control_mechanisms) above, and that the rest of the page is moved out of the way or hidden in some way while the menu is being accessed, to avoid confusion with navigating it.\n\nClick here for a [good hamburger menu example](https://fritz-weisshart.de/meg_men/).\n\n## [User input](#user_input)\n\nOn mobile devices, inputting data tends to be more annoying for users than the equivalent experience on desktop computers. It is more convenient to type text into form inputs using a desktop or laptop keyboard than a touchscreen virtual keyboard or a tiny mobile physical keyboard.\n\nFor this reason, it is worth trying to minimize the amount of typing needed. As an example, instead of getting users to fill out their job title each time using a regular text input, you could instead offer a [`<select>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/select) menu containing the most common options (which also helps with consistency in data entry) and offer an \"Other\" option that displays a text field to type any outliers into. You can see a simple example of this idea in action in [common-job-types.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/accessibility/mobile/common-job-types.html) (see the [common jobs example live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/mobile/common-job-types.html)).\n\nIt is also worth considering the use of HTML form input types such as the date on mobile platforms as they handle them well \u00e2\u0080\u0094 both Android and iOS, for example, display usable widgets that fit well with the device experience. See [html5-form-examples.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/accessibility/mobile/html5-form-examples.html) for some examples (see the [HTML5 form examples live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/accessibility/mobile/html5-form-examples.html)) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 try loading these and manipulating them on mobile devices. For example:\n\n- Types `number`, `tel`, and `email` display suitable virtual keyboards for entering numbers/telephone numbers.\n- Types `time` and `date` display suitable pickers for selecting times and dates.\n\nIf you want to provide a different solution for desktops, you could always serve different markup to your mobile devices using feature detection. Check out our [feature detection article](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Testing/Feature_detection) for more information.\n\n## [Summary](#summary)\n\nIn this article, we have provided you with some details about common mobile accessibility-specific issues and how to overcome them.
