[\nHTML\n]\nAlthough the HTML standard treats some of these cases as non-conforming for authors, it is considered to \"allow these features\" for the purposes of this success criterion because the specification requires that user agents support handling these cases consistently. In practice, this criterion no longer provides any benefit to people with disabilities in itself.\nIssues such as missing roles due to inappropriately nested elements or incorrect states or names due to a duplicate ID are covered by different success criteria and should be reported under those criteria rather than as issues with 4.1.1.\nUnderstanding 4.1.1\nFor all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.\nNote:\nThis success criterion is primarily for web authors who develop or script their own user interface components.
