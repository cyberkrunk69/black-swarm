  "content_markdown": "## Associate a label with every form control\n\nUse a `for` attribute on the `<label>` element linked to the `id` attribute of the form element, or using WAI-ARIA attributes. In specific situations it may be acceptable to hide `<label>` elements visually, but in most cases labels are needed to help all readers understand the required input.\n\n## Include alternative text for images\n\nEnsure that alternative text for images is added to all informational and functional images. Use empty alternative text, `alt=\"\"` for decorative images, or include them in the CSS instead. Text alternatives are usually provided by those responsible for written content.\n\n## Identify page language and language changes\n\nIndicate the primary language of every page by using the `lang` attribute in the `html` tag, for example `<html lang=\"en\">`. Use the `lang` attribute on specific elements when the language of the element differs from the rest of the page.\n\n## Use mark-up to convey meaning and structure\n\nUse appropriate mark-up for headings, lists, tables, etc. HTML5 provides additional elements, such as `<nav>` and `<aside>`, to better structure your content. WAI-ARIA roles can provide additional meaning, for example, using `role=\"search\"` to identify search functionality. Work with designers and content writers to agree on meanings and then use them consistently.\n\n## Help users avoid and correct mistakes\n\nProvide clear instructions, error messages, and notifications to help users complete forms on your site.
