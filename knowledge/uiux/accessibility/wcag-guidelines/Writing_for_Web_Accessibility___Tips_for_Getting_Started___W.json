  "content": "Provide informative, unique page titles\nFor each web page, provide a short title that describes the page content and distinguishes it from other pages. The page title is often the same as the main heading of the page. Put the unique and most relevant information first; for example, put the name of the page before the name of the organization. For pages that are part of a multi-step process, include the current step in the page title.\nUse headings to convey meaning and structure\nUse short headings to group related paragraphs and clearly describe the sections. Good headings provide an outline of the content.\nMake link text meaningful\nWrite link text so that it describes the content of the link target. Avoid using ambiguous link text, such as \u2018click here\u2019 or \u2018read more\u2019. Indicate relevant information about the link target, such as document type and size, for example, \u2018Proposal Documents (RTF, 20MB)\u2019.\nWrite meaningful text alternatives for images\nFor every image, write alternative text that provides the information or function of the image. For purely decorative images, there is no need to write alternative text.\nCreate transcripts and captions for multimedia\nFor audio-only content, such as a podcast, provide a transcript. For audio and visual content, such as training videos, also provide captions. Include in the transcripts and captions the spoken information and sounds that are important for understanding the content, for example, \u2018door creaks\u2019. For video transcripts, also include a description of the important visual content, for example \u2018Athan leaves the room\u2019.\nProvide clear instructions\nEnsure that instructions, guidance, and error messages are clear, easy to understand, and avoid unnecessarily technical language. Describe input requirements, such as date formats.\nKeep content clear and concise\nUse simple language and formatting, as appropriate for the context.\nWrite in short, clear sentences and paragraphs.\nAvoid using unnecessarily complex words and phrases.\nExpand acronyms on first use. For example, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).\nConsider providing a glossary for terms readers may not know.\nUse list formatting as appropriate.\nConsider using images, illustrations, video, audio, and symbols to help clarify meaning.\nBack to Top",
