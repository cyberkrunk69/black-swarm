  "content": "Table of Contents\nThis checklist uses\nThe Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (\nWCAG\n)\nas a reference point. The WCAG is a shared standard for web content accessibility for individuals, organizations, and governments.\nThere are three levels of accessibility compliance in the WCAG, which reflect the priority of support:\nA: Essential\nIf this isn't met, assistive technology may not be able to read, understand, or fully operate the page or view.\nAA: Ideal Support\nRequired for\nmultiple government and public body websites\n. The A11Y Project strives for AA compliance.\nAAA: Specialized Support\nThis is typically reserved for parts of websites and web apps that serve a specialized audience.\nThis checklist targets many, but not all level A and AA concerns. Note that the different levels of WCAG support do not necessarily indicate an increased level of difficulty to implement.\nSuccess criteria\nEach item on this checklist has a corresponding WCAG \u201csuccess criterion.\u201d Success criterion are the specific, testable rules that power the WCAG, described by a reference number and short title. For example, the rule about text resizing is called\n1.4.4 Resize text\n.\nSome accessibility issues may have multiple success criterion apply to them. We have identified the one most relevant for each checklist item.\nDoes this checklist guarantee my site is accessible?\nNo. However, addressing the issues called out in this checklist will help improve the experience for everyone who uses your site.\nThe issues this checklist prompts you to check for covers a wide range of disability conditions. There is no such thing as \u201cperfect accessibility\u201d or a site being \u201c100% accessible.\u201d You should be wary of companies and services that make such promises. If you need professional accessibility help, use\nprofessional accessibility services\n.\nContent\nContent is the most important part of your site.\nTask: Use plain language and avoid figures of speech, idioms, and complicated metaphors.\nUse plain language and avoid figures of speech, idioms, and complicated metaphors.\n3.1.5 Reading Level\nWrite content at\nan 8th grade reading level\n.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Use plain language and avoid figures of speech, idioms, and complicated metaphors.\nTask: Make sure that\nbutton\n,\na\n, and\nlabel\nelement content is unique and descriptive.\nMake sure that\nbutton\n,\na\n, and\nlabel\nelement content is unique and descriptive.\n1.3.1 Info and Relationships\nTerms like \u201cclick here\u201d and \u201cread more\u201d do not provide any context. Some people navigate using a list of all buttons or links on a page or view. When using this mode, the terms indicate what will happen if navigated to or activated.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Make sure that\nbutton\n,\na\n, and\nlabel\nelement content is unique and descriptive.\nTask: Use left-aligned text for left-to-right (\nLTR\n) languages, and right-aligned text for right-to-left (\nRTL\n) languages.\nUse left-aligned text for left-to-right (\nLTR\n) languages, and right-aligned text for right-to-left (\nRTL\n) languages.\n1.4.8 Visual Presentation\nCentered-aligned or justified text is difficult to read.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Use left-aligned text for left-to-right (\nLTR\n) languages, and right-aligned text for right-to-left (\nRTL\n) languages.\nGlobal code\nGlobal code is code that affects your entire website or web app.\nTask: Validate your HTML.\nValidate your HTML.\n4.1.1 Parsing\nValid HTML\nhelps to provide a consistent, expected experience across all browsers and assistive technology.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Validate your HTML.\nTask: Use a\nlang\nattribute on the\nhtml\nelement.\nUse a\nlang\nattribute on the\nhtml\nelement.\n3.1.1 Language of Page\nThis helps assistive technology such as screen readers to\npronounce content correctly\n.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Use a\nlang\nattribute on the\nhtml\nelement.\nTask: Provide a unique\ntitle\nfor each page or view.\nProvide a unique\ntitle\nfor each page or view.\n2.4.2 Page Titled\nThe\ntitle\nelement, contained in the document's\nhead\nelement, is often the first piece of information announced by assistive technology. This helps tell people what page or view they are going to start navigating.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Provide a unique\ntitle\nfor each page or view.\nTask: Ensure that viewport zoom is not disabled.\nEnsure that viewport zoom is not disabled.\n1.4.4 Resize text\nSome people need to increase the size of text to a point where they can read it. Do not stop them from doing this, even for web apps with a native app-like experience. Even native apps should respect Operating System settings for resizing text.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Ensure that viewport zoom is not disabled.\nTask: Use landmark elements to indicate important content regions.\nUse landmark elements to indicate important content regions.\n4.1.2 Name, Role, Value\nLandmark regions\nhelp communicate the layout and important areas of a page or view, and can allow quick access to these regions. For example, use the\nnav\nelement to wrap a site's navigation, and the\nmain\nelement to contain the primary content of a page.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Use landmark elements to indicate important content regions.\nTask: Ensure a linear content flow.\nEnsure a linear content flow.\n2.4.3 Focus Order\nRemove\ntabindex\nattribute values that aren't either\n0\nor\n-1\n. Elements that are inherently focusable, such as links or\nbutton\nelements, do not require a\ntabindex\n. Elements that are not inherently focusable should not have a\ntabindex\napplied to them outside of very specific use cases.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Ensure a linear content flow.\nTask: Avoid using the\nautofocus\nattribute.\nAvoid using the\nautofocus\nattribute.\n2.4.3 Focus Order\nPeople who are blind or who have low vision may be disoriented when focus is moved without their permission. Additionally,\nautofocus\ncan be problematic for people with motor control disabilities, as it may create extra work for them to navigate out from the autofocused area and to other locations on the page/view.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Avoid using the\nautofocus\nattribute.\nTask: Allow extending session timeouts.\nAllow extending session timeouts.\n2.2.1 Timing Adjustable\nIf you cannot remove session timeouts altogether, then let the person using your site easily turn off, adjust, or extend their session well before it ends.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Allow extending session timeouts.\nTask: Remove\ntitle\nattribute tooltips.\nRemove\ntitle\nattribute tooltips.\n4.1.2 Name, Role, Value\nThe\ntitle\nattribute has numerous issues\n, and should not be used if the information provided is important for all people to access. An acceptable use for the\ntitle\nattribute would be labeling an\niframe\nelement to indicate what content it contains.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Remove\ntitle\nattribute tooltips.\nKeyboard\nIt is important that your interface and content can be operated, and navigated by use of a keyboard. Some people cannot use a mouse, or may be using other assistive technologies that may not allow for hovering or precise clicking.\nTask: Make sure there is a visible focus style for interactive elements that are navigated to via keyboard input.\nMake sure there is a visible focus style for interactive elements that are navigated to via keyboard input.\n2.4.7 Focus Visible\nCan a person navigating with a keyboard,\nswitch\n, voice control, or screen reader see where they currently are on the page?\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Make sure there is a visible focus style for interactive elements that are navigated to via keyboard input.\nTask: Check to see that keyboard focus order matches the visual layout.\nCheck to see that keyboard focus order matches the visual layout.\n1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence\nCan a person navigating with a keyboard or screen reader move around the page in a predictable way?\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Check to see that keyboard focus order matches the visual layout.\nTask: Remove invisible focusable elements.\nRemove invisible focusable elements.\n2.4.3 Focus Order\nRemove the ability to focus on elements that are not presently meant to be discoverable. This includes things like inactive drop down menus, off screen navigations, or modals.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Remove invisible focusable elements.\nImages\nImages are a very common part of most websites. Help make sure they can be enjoyed by all.\nTask: Make sure that all\nimg\nelements have an\nalt\nattribute.\nMake sure that all\nimg\nelements have an\nalt\nattribute.\n1.1.1 Non-text Content\nalt\nattributes (alt text) give a description of an image for people who may not be able to view them. When an\nalt\nattribute isn't present on an image, a screen reader may announce the image's file name and path instead. This fails to communicate the image\u2019s content.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Make sure that all\nimg\nelements have an\nalt\nattribute.\nTask: Make sure that decorative images use null\nalt\n(empty) attribute values.\nMake sure that decorative images use null\nalt\n(empty) attribute values.\n1.1.1 Non-text Content\nNull\nalt\nattributes are also sometimes known as empty\nalt\nattributes. They are made by including no information between the opening and closing quotes of an\nalt\nattribute. Decorative images do not communicate information that is required to understand the website's overall meaning. Historically they were used for flourishes and\nspacer gif\nimages, but tend to be less relevant for modern websites and web apps.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Make sure that decorative images use null\nalt\n(empty) attribute values.\nTask: Provide a text alternative for complex images such as charts, graphs, and maps.\nProvide a text alternative for complex images such as charts, graphs, and maps.\n1.1.1 Non-text Content\nIs there a plain text which lists points on the map or sections of a flowchart? Describe all visible information. This includes graph axes, data points and labels, and the overall point the graphic is communicating.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Provide a text alternative for complex images such as charts, graphs, and maps.\nTask: For images containing text, make sure the alt description includes the image's text.\nFor images containing text, make sure the alt description includes the image's text.\n1.1.1 Non-text Content\nFor example, the FedEx logo should have an alt value of \u201cFedEx.\u201d\nShare Link\nto checklist item: For images containing text, make sure the alt description includes the image's text.\nHeadings\nHeading elements (h1, h2, h3, etc.) help break up the content of the page into related \u201cchunks\u201d of information. They are incredibly important for helping people who use assistive technology to understand the meaning of a page or view.\nTask: Use heading elements to introduce content.\nUse heading elements to introduce content.\n2.4.6 Headings or Labels\nHeading elements construct a document outline, and should not be used for purely visual design.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Use heading elements to introduce content.\nTask: Use only one\nh1\nelement per page or view.\nUse only one\nh1\nelement per page or view.\n2.4.6 Headings or Labels\nThe\nh1\nelement should be used to communicate the high-level purpose of the page or view. Do not use the\nh1\nelement for a heading that does not change between pages or views (for example, the site's name).\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Use only one\nh1\nelement per page or view.\nTask: Heading elements should be written in a logical sequence.\nHeading elements should be written in a logical sequence.\n2.4.6 Headings or Labels\nThe order of heading elements\nshould descend, based on the \u201cdepth\u201d of the content. For example, a\nh4\nelement should not appear on a page before the first\nh3\nelement declaration. A tool such as\nheadingsMap\ncan help you evaluate this.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Heading elements should be written in a logical sequence.\nTask: Don't skip heading levels.\nDon't skip heading levels.\n2.4.6 Headings or Labels\nFor example, don't jump from a\nh2\nto a\nh4\n, skipping a\nh3\nelement. If heading levels are being skipped for a specific visual treatment, use CSS classes instead.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Don't skip heading levels.\nLists\nLists elements let people know a collection of items are related and if they are sequential, and how many items are present in the list grouping.\nTask: Use list elements (\nol\n,\nul\n, and\ndl\nelements) for list content.\nUse list elements (\nol\n,\nul\n, and\ndl\nelements) for list content.\n1.3.1 Info and Relationships\nThis may include sections of related content, items visually displayed in a grid-like layout, or sibling a elements.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Use list elements (\nol\n,\nul\n, and\ndl\nelements) for list content.\nControls\nControls are interactive elements such as links and buttons that let a person navigate to a destination or perform an action.\nTask: Use the\na\nelement for links.\nUse the\na\nelement for links.\n1.3.1 Info and Relationships\nLinks should always have a\nhref\nattribute, even when used in Single Page Applications (\nSPA\ns). Without a\nhref\nattribute, the link will not be properly exposed to assistive technology. An example of this would be a link that uses an\nonclick\nevent, in place of a\nhref\nattribute.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Use the\na\nelement for links.\nTask: Ensure that links are recognizable as links.\nEnsure that links are recognizable as links.\n1.4.1 Use of Color\nColor alone is not sufficient to indicate the presence of a link. Underlines are a popular and commonly-understood way to communicate the presence of link content.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Ensure that links are recognizable as links.\nTask: Ensure that controls have\n:focus\nstates.\nEnsure that controls have\n:focus\nstates.\n2.4.7 Focus Visible\nVisible focus styles help people determine which interactive element has keyboard focus. This lets them know that they can perform actions like activating a button or navigating to a link's destination.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Ensure that controls have\n:focus\nstates.\nTask: Use the\nbutton\nelement for buttons.\nUse the\nbutton\nelement for buttons.\n1.3.1 Info and Relationships\nButtons are used to submit data or perform an on-screen action which does not shift keyboard focus. You can add\ntype=\"button\"\nto a\nbutton\nelement to prevent the browser from attempting to submit form information when activated.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Use the\nbutton\nelement for buttons.\nTask: Provide a skip link and make sure that it is visible when focused.\nProvide a skip link and make sure that it is visible when focused.\n2.4.1 Bypass Blocks\nA\nskip link\ncan be used to provide quick access to the main content of a page or view. This allows a person to easily bypass globally repeated content such as a website's primary navigation, or persistent search widget.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Provide a skip link and make sure that it is visible when focused.\nTask: Identify links that open in a new tab or window.\nIdentify links that open in a new tab or window.\nG201: Giving users advanced warning when opening a new window\nIdeally, avoid links that open in a new tab or window. If a link does, ensure the link's behavior will be communicated in a way that is apparent to all users. Doing this will help people understand what will happen before activating the link. While this technique is technically not required for compliance, it is an often-cited area of frustration for many different kinds of assistive technology users.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Identify links that open in a new tab or window.\nTables\nTables are a structured set of data that help people understand the relationships between different types of information.\nTask: Use the\ntable\nelement to describe tabular data.\nUse the\ntable\nelement to describe tabular data.\n1.3.1 Info and Relationships\nDo you need to display data in rows and columns? Use the\ntable\nelement.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Use the\ntable\nelement to describe tabular data.\nTask: Use the\nth\nelement for table headers (with appropriate\nscope\nattributes).\nUse the\nth\nelement for table headers (with appropriate\nscope\nattributes).\n4.1.1 Parsing\nDepending on\nhow complex your table is\n, you may also consider using\nscope=\"col\"\nfor column headers, and\nscope=\"row\"\nfor row headers. Many different kinds of assistive technology still use the\nscope\nattribute to help them understand and describe the structure of a table.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Use the\nth\nelement for table headers (with appropriate\nscope\nattributes).\nTask: Use the\ncaption\nelement to provide a title for the table.\nUse the\ncaption\nelement to provide a title for the table.\n2.4.6 Headings or Labels\nThe table's\ncaption\nshould describe what kind of information the table contains.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: Use the\ncaption\nelement to provide a title for the table.\nForms\nForms allow people to enter information into a site for processing and manipulation. This includes things like sending messages and placing orders.\nTask: All inputs in a form are associated with a corresponding\nlabel\nelement.\nAll inputs in a form are associated with a corresponding\nlabel\nelement.\n3.2.2 On Input\nUse a\nfor\n/\nid\npairing to guarantee the highest level of browser/assistive technology support.\nShare Link\nto checklist item: All inputs in a form are associated with a corresponding\nlabel\nelement.\nTask: Use\nfieldset\nand\nlegend\nelements where appropriate.\nUse\nfieldset\nand\nlegend\nelements where appropriate.\n1.3.1 Info and Relationships\nDoes your form contain multiple sections of related inputs?
