page, they enable structural information that is conveyed visually through layout to be represented programmatically.\n          Screen readers exploit landmark roles to provide keyboard navigation to important sections of a page.\n          Landmark regions can also be used as targets for \"skip links\" and by browser extensions to enhanced keyboard navigation.\nThis section explains how HTML sectioning elements and ARIA landmark roles are used to make it easy for assistive technology users to understand the meaning of the layout of a page.\nHTML Sectioning Elements\nThe following HTML sectioning elements create ARIA landmark regions.\nLandmark roles generated by HTML sectioning elements\nHTML Element\nImplied Landmark Role\naside\ncomplementary\nfooter\nif it is in the context of a\nbody\nelement\ncontentinfo\nheader\nif it is in the context of a\nbody\nelement\nbanner\nmain\nmain\nnav\nnavigation\nsection\nif it has an accessible name provided

landmark region a semantically meaningful role is one of the most effective ways of ensuring assistive technology users will not overlook information that is relevant to their needs.\nStep 1: Identify the logical structure\nBreak the page into perceivable areas of content which designers typically indicate visually using alignment and spacing.\nAreas can be further defined into logical sub-areas as needed.\nAn example of a sub-area is a portlet in a portal application.\nStep 2: Assign landmark roles to each area\nAssign landmark roles based on the type of content in the area.\nbanner\n,\nmain\n,\ncomplementary\nand\ncontentinfo\nlandmarks should be top level landmarks.\nLandmark roles can be nested to identify parent/child relationships of the information being presented.\nNote that wrapping  the content  of a modal dialog in a landmark region is unnecessary.\n            A landmark that wraps modal content cannot provide any benefit to users because it is not perceivable unless the modal is open.\n            In addition, when a modal is open, a landmark containing its content is superfluous because the modal itself is a container that provides both a name and boundaries.\nStep 3: Label areas\nIf a specific landmark role is used more than once on a page, provide each instance of that landmark with a unique label.\n            There is one rare circumstance where providing the same label to multiple instances of a landmark can be beneficial: the content and purpose of each instance is identical.\n            For example, a large search results table has two sets of identical pagination controls -- one above and one below the table, so each set is in a navigation region labelled\nSearch Results\n.\n            In this case, adding extra information to the label that distinguishes the two instances may be more distracting than helpful.\nIf a landmark is only used once on the page it may not require a label.\n            See Landmark Roles section below.\nIf an area begins with a heading element (e.g.\nh1-h6\n) it can be used as the label for the area using the\naria-labelledby\nattribute.\nIf an area requires a label and does not have a heading element, provide a label using the\naria-label\nattribute.\nDo not use the landmark role as part of the label.\n            For example, a navigation landmark with a label \"Site Navigation\" will be announced by a screen reader as \"Site Navigation Navigation\".\n            The label should simply be \"Site\".\nLandmark Roles\nBanner\nA\nbanner\nlandmark identifies site-oriented content at the beginning of each page within a website.\n            Site-oriented content typically includes things such as the logo or identity of the site sponsor, and site-specific search tool.\n            A banner usually appears at the top of the page and typically spans the full width.\nEach page may have one\nbanner\nlandmark.\nThe\nbanner\nlandmark should be a top-level landmark.\nWhen a page contains nested\ndocument\nand/or\napplication\nroles (e.g. typically through the use of\niframe\nand\nframe\nelements), each\ndocument\nor\napplication\nrole may have one\nbanner\nlandmark.\nIf a page includes more than one\nbanner\nlandmark, each should have a unique label (see\nStep 3\nabove).\nHTML Techniques\nThe HTML\nheader\nelement defines a\nbanner\nlandmark when its context is the\nbody\nelement.\nThe HTML\nheader\nelement is not considered a\nbanner\nlandmark when it is descendant of any of following elements (see\nHTML Accessibility Mappings\n):\narticle\naside\nmain\nnav\nsection\nARIA Techniques\nIf the HTML\nheader\nelement technique is not being used, a\nrole=\"banner\"\nattribute should be used to define a\nbanner\nlandmark.\nExamples\nBanner Landmark Example\nComplementary\nA\ncomplementary\nlandmark is a supporting section of the document, designed to be complementary to the main content at a similar level in the DOM hierarchy, but remains meaningful when separated from the main content.\ncomplementary\nlandmarks should be top level landmarks (e.g. not contained within any other landmarks).\nIf the complementary content is not related to the main content, a more general role should be assigned (e.g.\nregion\n).\nIf a page includes more than one\ncomplementary\nlandmark, each should have a unique label (see\nStep 3\nabove).\nHTML Technique\nUse the HTML\naside\nelement to define a\ncomplementary\nlandmark.\nARIA Technique\nIf the HTML\naside\nelement technique is not being used, use a\nrole=\"complementary\"\nattribute to define a\ncomplementary\nlandmark.\nExamples\nComplementary Landmark Example\nContentinfo\nA\ncontentinfo\nlandmark is a way to identify common information at the bottom of each page within a website, typically called the \"footer\" of the page, including information such as copyrights and links to privacy and accessibility statements.\nEach page may have one\ncontentinfo\nlandmark.\nThe\ncontentinfo\nlandmark should be a top-level landmark.\nWhen a page contains nested\ndocument\nand/or\napplication\nroles (e.g. typically through the use of\niframe\nand\nframe\nelements), each\ndocument\nor\napplication\nrole may have one\ncontentinfo\nlandmark.\nIf a page includes more than one\ncontentinfo\nlandmark, each should have a unique label (see\nStep 3\nabove).\nHTML Techniques\nThe HTML\nfooter\nelement defines a\ncontentinfo\nlandmark when its context is the\nbody\nelement.\nThe HTML\nfooter\nelement is not considered a\ncontentinfo\nlandmark when it is descendant of any of following elements (see\nHTML Accessibility Mappings\n):\narticle\naside\nmain\nnav\nsection\nARIA Technique\nIf the HTML\nfooter\nelement technique is not being used, a\nrole=\"contentinfo\"\nattribute should be used to define a\ncontentinfo\nlandmark.\nExamples\nContentinfo Landmark Example\nForm\nA\nform\nlandmark identifies a region that contains a collection of items and objects that, as a whole, combine to create a form when no other named landmark is appropriate (e.g. main or search).\nUse the\nsearch\nlandmark instead of the\nform\nlandmark when the form is used for search functionality.\nA\nform\nlandmark should have a label to help users understand the purpose of the form.\nA label for the\nform\nlandmark should be visible to all users (e.g. an\nh1-h6\nelement).\nIf a page includes more than one\nform\nlandmark, each should have a unique label (see\nStep 3\nabove).\nWhenever possible, controls contained in a\nform\nlandmark in an HTML document should use native host semantics:\nbutton\ninput\nselect\ntextarea\nHTML Techniques\nThe HTML\nform\nelement defines a\nform\nlandmark when it has an accessible name (e.g.\naria-labelledby\n,\naria-label\nor\ntitle\n).\nARIA Technique\nUse the\nrole=\"form\"\nto identify a region of the page; do not use it to identify every form field.\nExamples\nForm Landmark Example\nMain\nA\nmain\nlandmark identifies the primary content of the page.\nEach page should have one\nmain\nlandmark.\nThe\nmain\nlandmark should be a top-level landmark.\nWhen a page contains nested\ndocument\nand/or\napplication\nroles (e.g. typically through the use of\niframe\nand\nframe\nelements), each\ndocument\nor\napplication\nrole may have one\nmain\nlandmark.\nIf a page includes more than one\nmain\nlandmark, each should have a unique label (see\nStep 3\nabove).\nHTML Technique\nUse the HTML\nmain\nelement to define a\nmain\nlandmark.\nARIA Technique\nIf the HTML\nmain\nelement technique is not being used, use a\nrole=\"main\"\nattribute to define a\nmain\nlandmark.\nExamples\nMain Landmark Example\nNavigation\nNavigation\nlandmarks provide a way to identify groups (e.g. lists) of links that are intended to be used for website or page content navigation.\nIf a page includes more than one\nnavigation\nlandmark, each should have a unique label (see\nStep 3\nabove).\nIf a\nnavigation\nlandmark has an identical set of links as another\nnavigation\nlandmark on the page, use the same label for each\nnavigation\nlandmark.\nHTML Technique\nUse the HTML\nnav\nelement to define a\nnavigation\nlandmark.\nARIA Technique\nIf the HTML\nnav\nelement technique is not being used, use a\nrole=\"navigation\"\nattribute to define a\nnavigation\nlandmark.\nExamples\nNavigation Landmark Example\nRegion\nA\nregion\nlandmark is a perceivable section of the page containing content that is sufficiently important for users to be able to navigate to the section.\nA\nregion\nlandmark must have a label.\nIf a page includes more than one\nregion\nlandmark, each should have a unique label (see\nStep 3\nabove).\nThe\nregion\nlandmark can be used to identify content that named landmarks do not appropriately describe.\nHTML Technique\nThe HTML\nsection\nelement defines a\nregion\nlandmark when it has an accessible name (e.g.\naria-labelledby\n,\naria-label\nor\ntitle\n).\nARIA Technique\nIf the HTML\nsection\nelement technique is not being used, use a\nrole=\"region\"\nattribute to define a\nregion\nlandmark.\nExamples\nRegion Landmark Example\nSearch\nA\nsearch\nlandmark contains a collection of items and objects that, as a whole, combine to create search functionality.\nUse

Banner\n\nA [`banner`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#banner) landmark identifies site-oriented content at the beginning of each page within a website.\nSite-oriented content typically includes things such as the logo or identity of the site sponsor, and site-specific search tool.\nA banner usually appears at the top of the page and typically spans the full width.\n\n- Each page may have one `banner` landmark.\n- The `banner` landmark should be a top-level landmark.\n- When a page contains nested `document` and/or `application` roles (e.g. typically through the use of `iframe` and `frame`
