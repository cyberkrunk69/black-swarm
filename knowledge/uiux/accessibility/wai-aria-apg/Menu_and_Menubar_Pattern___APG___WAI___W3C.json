  "content": "Menu and Menubar Pattern\nAbout This Pattern\nA\nmenu\nis a widget that offers a list of choices to the user, such as a set of actions or functions.\n          Menu widgets behave like native operating system menus, such as the menus that pull down from the menubars commonly found at the top of many desktop application windows.\n          A menu is usually opened, or made visible, by activating a\nmenu button\n, choosing an item in a menu that opens a sub menu, or by invoking a command, such as\nShift\n+\nF10\nin Windows, that opens a context specific menu.\n          When a user activates a choice in a menu, the menu usually closes unless the choice opened a submenu.\nA menu that is visually persistent is a\nmenubar\n.\n          A menubar is typically horizontal and is often used to create a menu bar similar to those found near the top of the window in many desktop applications, offering the user quick access to a consistent set of commands.\nA common convention for indicating that a menu item launches a dialog box is to append \"\u2026\" (ellipsis) to the menu item label, e.g., \"Save as \u2026\".\nExamples\nEditor Menubar Example\n: Demonstrates menu radios and menu checkboxes in submenus of a menubar that provides text formatting commands for a text field.\nNavigation Menubar Example\n: Demonstrates a menubar that provides site navigation.\nKeyboard Interaction\nThe following description of keyboard behaviors assumes:\nA horizontal\nmenubar\ncontaining several\nmenuitem\n,\nmenuitemradio\n, or\nmenuitemcheckbox\nelements.\nSome\nmenuitem\nelements in the\nmenubar\nhave child submenus that contain vertically arranged items.\nSome of the\nmenuitem\nelements in the submenus have child submenus with items that are also vertically arranged.\nWhen reading the following descriptions, also keep in mind that:\nFocusable elements, which may have role\nmenuitem\n,\nmenuitemradio\n, or\nmenuitemcheckbox\n, are referred to as items.\nIf a behavior applies to only certain types of items, e.g.,\nmenuitem\nelements, the specific role name is used.\nSubmenus, also known as popup menus, are elements with role\nmenu\n.\nExcept where noted, menus opened from a menubutton behave the same as menus opened from a menubar.\nWhen a\nmenu\nopens, or when a\nmenubar\nreceives focus, keyboard focus is placed on the first item.\n          Because\nmenubar\nand\nmenu\nelements are composite widgets as described in the practice for\nKeyboard Navigation Inside Components\n,\nTab\nand\nShift\n+\nTab\ndo not move focus among the items in the menu.\n          Instead, the keyboard commands described in this section enable users to move focus among the elements in a\nmenubar\nor\nmenu\n.\nTab\nand\nShift\n+\nTab\n:\nMove focus into a\nmenubar\n:\nIf focus is moving into the\nmenubar\nfor the first time, focus is set on the first\nmenuitem\n.\nIf the\nmenubar\nhas previously contained focus, focus is optionally set on the\nmenuitem\nthat last had focus.\n                    Otherwise, it is set on the first\nmenuitem\nthat is not disabled.\nWhen focus is on a\nmenuitem\nin a\nmenu\nor\nmenubar\n, move focus out of the\nmenu\nor\nmenubar\n, and close all menus and submenus.\nNote that\nTab\nand\nShift\n+\nTab\ndo not move focus into a\nmenu\n.\n                Unlike a\nmenubar\n, a\nmenu\nis not visually persistent, and authors are responsible for ensuring focus moves to an item inside of a\nmenu\nwhen the\nmenu\nopens.\nEnter\n:\nWhen focus is on a\nmenuitem\nthat has a submenu, opens the submenu and places focus on its first item.\nOtherwise, activates the item and closes the menu.\nSpace\n:\n(Optional): When focus is on a\nmenuitemcheckbox\n, changes the state without closing the menu.\n(Optional): When focus is on a\nmenuitemradio\nthat is not checked, without closing the menu, checks the focused\nmenuitemradio\nand unchecks any other checked\nmenuitemradio\nelement in the same group.\n(Optional): When focus is on a\nmenuitem\nthat has a submenu, opens the submenu and places focus on its first item.\n(Optional): When focus is on a\nmenuitem\nthat does not have a submenu, activates the\nmenuitem\nand closes the menu.\nDown Arrow\n:\nWhen focus is on a\nmenuitem\nin a\nmenubar\n, and that\nmenuitem\nhas a submenu, opens the submenu and places focus on the first item in the submenu.\nWhen focus is in a\nmenu\n, moves focus to the next item, optionally wrapping from the last to the first.\nUp Arrow\n:\nWhen focus is in a\nmenu\n, moves focus to the previous item, optionally wrapping from the first to the last.\n(Optional): When focus is on a\nmenuitem\nin a\nmenubar\n, and that\nmenuitem\nhas a submenu, opens the submenu and places focus on the last item in the submenu.\nRight Arrow\n:\nWhen focus is in a\nmenubar\n, moves focus to the next item, optionally wrapping from the last to the first.\nWhen focus is in a\nmenu\nand on a\nmenuitem\nthat has a submenu, opens the submenu and places focus on its first item.\nWhen focus is in a\nmenu\nand on an item that does not have a submenu, performs the following 3 actions:\nCloses the submenu and any parent menus.\nMoves focus to the next item in the\nmenubar\n.\nIf focus is now on a\nmenuitem\nwith a submenu, either: (Recommended) opens the submenu of that\nmenuitem\nwithout moving focus into the submenu, or opens the submenu of that\nmenuitem\nand places focus on the first item in the submenu.\nNote that if the\nmenubar\nwere not present, e.g., the menus were opened from a menubutton,\nRight Arrow\nwould not do anything when focus is on an item that does not have a submenu.\nLeft Arrow\n:\nWhen focus is in a\nmenubar\n, moves focus to the previous item, optionally wrapping from the first to the last.\nWhen focus is in a submenu of an item in a\nmenu\n, closes the submenu and returns focus to the parent\nmenuitem\n.\nWhen focus is in a submenu of an item in a\nmenubar\n, performs the following 3 actions:\nCloses the submenu.\nMoves focus to the previous item in the\nmenubar\n.\nIf focus is now on a\nmenuitem\nwith a submenu, either: (Recommended) opens the submenu of that\nmenuitem\nwithout moving focus into the submenu, or opens the submenu of that\nmenuitem\nand places focus on the first item in the submenu.\nHome\n: If arrow key wrapping is not supported, moves focus to the first item in the current\nmenu\nor\nmenubar\n.\nEnd\n: If arrow key wrapping is not supported, moves focus to the last item in the current\nmenu\nor\nmenubar\n.\nAny key that corresponds to a printable character (Optional): Move focus to the next item in the current menu whose label begins with that printable character.\nEscape\n: Close the menu that contains focus and return focus to the element or context, e.g., menu button or parent\nmenuitem\n, from which the menu was opened.\nNote\nDisabled menu items are focusable but cannot be activated.\nA\nseparator\nin a menu is not focusable or interactive.\nIf a menu is opened or a menubar receives focus as a result of a context action,\nEscape\nor\nEnter\nmay return focus to the invoking context.\n              For example, a rich text editor may have a menubar that receives focus when a shortcut key, e.g.,\nalt\n+\nF10\n, is pressed while editing.\n              In this case, pressing\nEscape\nor activating a command from the menu may return focus to the editor.\nAlthough it is recommended that authors avoid doing so, some implementations of navigation menubars may have\nmenuitem\nelements that both perform a function and open a submenu.\n              In such implementations,\nEnter\nand\nSpace\nperform a navigation function, e.g., load new content, while\nDown Arrow\n, in a horizontal menubar, opens the submenu associated with that same\nmenuitem\n.\nWhen items in a\nmenubar\nare arranged vertically and items in\nmenu\ncontainers are arranged horizontally:\nDown Arrow\nperforms as\nRight Arrow\nis described above, and vice versa.\nUp Arrow\nperforms as\nLeft Arrow\nis described above, and vice versa.\nWAI-ARIA Roles, States, and Properties\nA menu is a container of items that represent choices.\n            The element serving as the menu has a role of either\nmenu\nor\nmenubar\n.\nThe items contained in a menu are child elements of the containing menu or menubar and have any of the following roles:\nmenuitem\nmenuitemcheckbox\nmenuitemradio\nIf activating a\nmenuitem\nopens a submenu, the menuitem is known as a parent menuitem.\n            A submenu's\nmenu\nelement is:\nContained inside the same\nmenu\nelement as its parent\nmenuitem\n.\nIs the sibling element immediately following its parent\nmenuitem\n.\nA parent menuitem has\naria-haspopup\nset to either\nmenu\nor\ntrue\n.\nA parent menuitem has\naria-expanded\nset to\nfalse\nwhen its child menu is not visible and set to\ntrue\nwhen the child menu is visible.\nOne of the following approaches is used to enable scripts to move focus among items in a menu as described in the practice for\nKeyboard Navigation Inside Components\n:\nThe menu container has\ntabindex\nset to\n-1\nor\n0\nand\naria-activedescendant\nset to the ID of the focused item.\nEach item in the menu has\ntabindex\nset to\n-1\n, except in a menubar, where the first item has\ntabindex\nset to\n0\n.\nWhen a\nmenuitemcheckbox\nor\nmenuitemradio\nis checked,\naria-checked\nis set to\ntrue\n.\nWhen a menu item is disabled,\naria-disabled\nis set to\ntrue\n.\nItems in a menu may be divided into groups by placing an element with a role of\nseparator\nbetween groups.\n            For example, this technique should be used when a menu contains a set of\nmenuitemradio\nitems.\nAll\nseparators\nshould have\naria-orientation\nconsistent with the separator's orientation.\nIf a menubar has a visible label, the element with role\nmenubar\nhas\naria-labelledby\nset to a value that refers to the labelling element.\n            Otherwise, the menubar element has a label provided by\naria-label\n.\nIf a menubar is vertically oriented, it has\naria-orientation\nset to\nvertical\n.\n            The default value of\naria-orientation\nfor a menubar is\nhorizontal\n.\nAn element with role\nmenu\neither has:\naria-labelledby\nset to a value that refers to the menuitem or button that controls its display.\nA label provided by\naria-label\n.\nIf a menu is horizontally oriented, it has\naria-orientation\nset to\nhorizontal\n.\n            The default value of\naria-orientation\nfor a menu is\nvertical\n.\nNote\nIf\naria-owns\nis set on the menu container to include elements that are not DOM children of the container, those elements will appear in the reading order in the sequence they are referenced and after any items that are DOM children.\n          Scripts that manage focus need to ensure the visual focus order matches this assistive technology reading order.",

A horizontal `menubar` containing several `menuitem`, `menuitemradio`, or `menuitemcheckbox` elements.\n2. Some `menuitem` elements in the `menubar` have child submenus that contain vertically arranged items.\n3. Some of the `menuitem` elements in the submenus have child submenus with items that are also vertically arranged.\n\nWhen reading the following descriptions, also keep in mind that:\n\n1.
