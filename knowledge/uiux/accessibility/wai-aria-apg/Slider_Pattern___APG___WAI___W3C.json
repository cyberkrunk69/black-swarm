Focus is placed on the slider (the visual object that the mouse user would move, also known as the thumb.\n2. In some circumstances, reversing the direction of the value change for the keys specified above, e.g., having `Up Arrow` decrease the value, could create a more intuitive experience.\n\n## WAI-ARIA Roles, States, and Properties\n\n- The element serving as the focusable slider control has role [slider](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#slider).\n- The slider element has the [aria-valuenow](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-valuenow) property set to a decimal value representing the current value of the slider.\n- The slider element has the [aria-valuemin](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-valuemin) property set to a decimal value representing the minimum allowed value of the slider.\n- The slider element has the [aria-valuemax](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-valuemax) property set to a decimal value representing the maximum allowed value of the slider.\n- If the value of `aria-valuenow` is not user-friendly, e.g., the day of the week is represented by a number, the [aria-valuetext](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-valuetext) property is set to a string that makes the slider value understandable, e.g., \"Monday\".\n- If the slider has a visible label, it is referenced by [aria-labelledby](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-labelledby) on the slider element.\n  Otherwise, the slider element has a label provided by [aria-label](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-label).\n- If the slider is vertically oriented, it has [aria-orientation](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-orientation) set to `vertical`.\n  The default value of `aria-orientation` for a slider is `horizontal`.",
