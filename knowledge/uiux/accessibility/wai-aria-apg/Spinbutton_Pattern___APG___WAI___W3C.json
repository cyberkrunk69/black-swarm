Any other character input does not change the contents of the text field nor the value of the spinbutton.\n\n### Note\n\n1. Focus remains on the text field during operation.\n2. Standard single line text editing keys appropriate for the device platform:\n   1. include keys for input, cursor movement, selection, and text manipulation.\n   2. Standard key assignments for editing functions depend on the device operating system.\n   3. The most robust approach for providing text editing functions is to rely on browsers, which supply them for HTML inputs with type text and for elements with the `contenteditable` HTML attribute.\n   4. **IMPORTANT:** Be sure that JavaScript does not interfere with browser-provided text editing functions by capturing key events for the keys used to perform them.\n\n## WAI-ARIA Roles, States, and Properties\n\n- The focusable element serving as the spinbutton has role [spinbutton](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#spinbutton).\n  This is typically an element that supports text input.\n- The spinbutton element has the [aria-valuenow](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-valuenow) property set to a decimal value representing the current value of the spinbutton.\n- The spinbutton element has the [aria-valuemin](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-valuemin) property set to a decimal value representing the minimum allowed value of the spinbutton if it has a known minimum value.\n- The spinbutton element has the [aria-valuemax](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-valuemax) property set to a decimal value representing the maximum allowed value of the spinbutton if it has a known maximum value.\n- If the value of `aria-valuenow` is not user-friendly, e.g., the day of the week is represented by a number, the [aria-valuetext](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-valuetext) property is set on the spinbutton element to a string that makes the spinbutton value understandable, e.g., \"Monday\".\n- If the spinbutton has a visible label, it is referenced by [aria-labelledby](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-labelledby) on the spinbutton element.\n  Otherwise, the spinbutton element has a label provided by [aria-label](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-label).\n- The spinbutton element has [aria-invalid](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-invalid) set to `true` if the value is outside the allowed range.\n  Note that most implementations prevent input of invalid values, but in some scenarios, blocking all invalid input may not be practical.",
