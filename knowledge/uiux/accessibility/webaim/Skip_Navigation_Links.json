This can be particularly difficult for users with some forms of motor disabilities. Consider users with no or limited arm movement who navigate a web page by tapping their heads on a switch or that use a stick in their mouth to press keyboard keys. Requiring users to perform any action numerous times before reaching the main content poses an accessibility barrier.\nOf course, sighted people who use their mouse do not have any trouble with web pages like this. They can almost immediately scan over the page and identify where the main content is. Skip navigation links are useful to give screen reader and keyboard users the same capability of navigating directly to the main content.\nCreating \"Skip Navigation\" Links\nThe idea is simple enough: provide a link at the top of the page that, when activated, jumps the user to the beginning of the main content area.\nVisible skip links\nThe easiest method of creating a skip navigation link is to put it at or near the top of the page in regular text. The key is to\nmake sure the link is one of the first items\nthat screen readers hear and that keyboard users navigate to using the keyboard (typically by pressing the\nTab\nkey). Otherwise, users may not realize there is a skip navigation link there and may waste time navigating through extraneous links. The link must also be apparent to be helpful.\nExample\nThe link is the first item in the page. The anchor or target for the link (where the link will jump the user to) is the main content region.\n<body>\n<a href=\"#maincontent\">Skip to main content</a>\n...\n<main id=\"maincontent\">\n<h1>Heading</h1>\n<p>This is the first paragraph</p>\nThe target is identified by its\nid\nattribute value matching the\nhref\nvalue (minus the \"#\") of the skip link. When the skip link is activated, keyboard focus will go to the\n<main>\nelement. Navigation and reading will proceed from this location in the page.\nAlternatively, you can use a named anchor to identify the target for the link, though named anchors are no longer conforming in HTML5.\n<h1>\n<a name=\"maincontent\" id=\"maincontent\"></a>\nHeading</h1>\n<p>This is the first paragraph</p>\nTemporarily hidden skip links\nMany designers worry about the aesthetic impact of visible skip navigation links. They may think these links are unattractive or confusing to users who do not need them, so they may decide to make them invisible. A very small or hidden link does not benefit the audience that most needs skip links\u2014sighted keyboard users. While screen readers have many mechanisms to jump around the page (e.g., headings and regions/landmarks), other keyboard users do not.\nTo address the concerns that a visible skip link can be intrusive, but still create a skip link that is useful for sighted keyboard users,\nwe recommend creating a link that is hidden until to the user navigates to it with a keyboard\n.\nTo be usable by all keyboard users, particularly sighted keyboard users, the link must:\nbe hidden by default\nbe accessible to keyboard navigation\nbecome prominently visible when it is focused\nproperly set focus to the main content area when activated\nProbably the most accessible method for visually hiding a skip link is to hide it off screen with CSS, then cause it to be positioned on screen when it receives keyboard focus. Because the link is still part of the accessible content on the page, keyboard and screen reader users can navigate it, and the link will become visible when accessed.\nSome techniques, such as hiding the skip link with CSS\ndisplay:none\nor the\nhidden\nattribute, will remove the link from keyboard navigation making it inaccessible to all users. Making the link the same color as the background or fully transparent, sizing the link to 0 pixels, or placing it on a one-pixel transparent image can also pose accessibility issues.\nImportant\nReview the article on\nInvisible Content Just for Screen Reader Users\nfor details on using CSS to hide skip links off-screen.\nOne potential issue with this approach is that if the user navigates very quickly using the\nTab\nkey, the link may be visible on the page for only a fraction of a second and may be overlooked. This can be partially addressed by ensuring that the skip link is very visually distinctive at the top of the page when visible. Additionally, one could use scripting or CSS transitions to cause the link to animate so it remains visible on screen for more time.\nNote\nNavigate the links at the beginning of this page using the\nTab\nkey to see an example of a hidden skip link that becomes visible on keyboard focus using CSS transitions to make it visually distinctive and persistent on screen for at least a moment.\nWhich wording is best?\nThere are multiple ways that the skip link could be worded:\nSkip navigation\nSkip main navigation\nSkip navigation links\nSkip to main content\nSkip to content\nAny of these may be sufficient so long as the purpose of the link is clearly described. In general, we prefer \"Skip to main content\" as it explains where the user is navigating to versus what they are navigating past.\nMultiple skip links are usually unnecessary\nWhat if a page has multiple sections or multiple levels of navigational links? Should developers provide a skip navigation link to each of these sections or to skip over each level of navigational?\nIn most cases, a single skip link is sufficient.\nFor pages that have very few navigable items preceding the main content, a skip link may not be necessary at all. On the other hand, a very complex page with several repeated elements may necessitate additional skip links. Remember, the purpose of skip navigation links is to make keyboard navigation more efficient. Adding more links increases link-clutter. At what point will you need to add a \"Skip the skip links\" link?!\nIn-page links elsewhere in a page can also be used to allow users to jump to or jump over other types of page content. The \"Article Contents\" at the top of this page, for example, includes in-page links to facilitate navigation to major page sections. A skip link could also be used to allow the user to quickly bypass confusing or potentially inaccessible content, such as ASCII art, complex tables, or complex social media feeds.\nOther In-page Navigation Options\nWCAG conformance\nWCAG 2.4.1 (Bypass Blocks - Level A)\nstates, \"A mechanism is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple Web pages.\" This does not necessarily require that a skip link be present. Beginning the main content with an\n<h1>\nor using a\n<main>\nregion would be a sufficient \"mechanism\". However because neither of these techniques are highly useful for sighted keyboard users absent a screen reader or specialized software, a skip link is strongly recommended for optimal accessibility on pages with repeated navigation.\nHeadings and regions\nImplementing proper\nheading structures\n(especially starting the main content with an\n<h1>\n) and\nregions\n(especially\n<nav>\nand\n<main>\n) is a vital aspect of keyboard accessibility.
