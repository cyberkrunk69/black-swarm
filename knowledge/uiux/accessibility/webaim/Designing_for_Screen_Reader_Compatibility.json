They empower users to hear content and navigate with the keyboard. The technology helps people who are blind or who have low vision to use information technology with the same level of independence and privacy as anyone else. Screen readers are also used by people with certain cognitive or learning disabilities, or users who simply prefer audio content over text. Beyond the web, screen readers also work with documents, spreadsheets, and the user\u2019s operating system.\nScreen readers read content differently from humans. The voice may sound somewhat robotic and monotone. Experienced users often like to speed up the reading rate to 300 words per minute or more\u2014well beyond what an inexperienced listener can easily understand. It takes time to get used to a screen reader, but once users become accustomed to it, they can race through content at speeds that awe sighted individuals.\nDocument Language\nSince every language has its own pronunciation rules, the screen reader needs to know which language it should \"speak.\" Web pages specify document language with a\nlang\nattribute on the\n<html>\ntag, in order to encompass the entire document. The page you are reading right now uses\n<html lang=\"en\">\n, with \"en\" being the code for English. This also facilitates automatic translation of content.\nSometimes text is interspersed with foreign phrases. For example:\n\u201cC\u2019est la vie,\u201d\nHarold sighed, as he watched his Volvo tumble off the cliff.\nIn such cases, the\nlang\nattribute (in this case\nlang=\"fr\"\n) is typically applied to a\n<span>\ntag surrounding the other-language content. This flags a temporary departure from the previously-specified document language.\nNote\nYou can learn much more about choosing and implementing proper lang attribute values in the\nDocument and Content Language\narticle.\nContent Linearization\nAudio interfaces present content linearly to users, one item at a time. This contrasts with the way in which most people use visual interfaces. Sighted users can scan an entire screen almost instantaneously, comprehending the overall layout, the artistic style, and other macro-level aspects of the content. Screen reader users cannot comprehend these macro-level aspects as quickly. The linear progression through the content from beginning to end is somewhat like automated telephone menu systems which do not reveal all of the options at once. Users must progress through such systems in a step-wise manner. The insight that audio interfaces are linearized versions of web content is an important one that should guide web developers during the engineering and design process.\nNavigating Content\nDespite the linear nature of audio interfaces, screen readers do provide ways for users to navigate content quickly.\nLinks and Form Controls\nOne way is to use the\nTab\nkey to jump from link to link. This gives the user an idea of where the page links to, and can be a useful way to run through the content if the user is looking for a specific link. A related technique is to obtain a list of the links on the page, arranged alphabetically. The drawback of these methods is that the user does not hear any of the non-link content, and may miss important information this way. See\nhttp://webaim.org/techniques/hypertext/\n.\nImplication:\nLinks should make sense when read out of context.\nHeadings\nAnother way to get an overall impression of a page's content is to jump from heading to heading. Users can hear an outline of the page's main ideas, then backtrack to read the parts they are most interested in. The main drawback to this technique is that it relies on headings\u2014which too many pages lack. See\nhttp://webaim.org/techniques/semanticstructure/\n.\nImplication:\nAuthors should organize content with headings. To the extent possible, the headings should represent an accurate outline of the content.\nLandmarks and page sections\nUsers can navigate via\nARIA landmarks\nand HTML5 sectioning elements, such as\n<main>\n,\n<nav>\n,\n<header>\n, etc.\nImplication:\nDefine appropriate ARIA landmarks and use HTML5 elements appropriately.\nParagraphs and page elements\nUsers can jump from paragraph to paragraph, listening to the first sentence or two before moving on to the next paragraph. This technique resembles the way visual users explore the page before focusing on an area of interest. Users can also jump from element to element, such as\n<div>\ntags, links, form elements, list items, or other units of content.\nImplication:\nWhen possible, place the distinguishing information of a paragraph in the first sentence.\n\u201cSkip navigation\u201d links\nSkip links\nat the top of the page allow users to bypass the main navigation and go directly to the main content. They speed up the reading process and help users distinguish between the main navigation and the main content.\nImplication:\nWhere appropriate, allow users to skip over repetitive navigation links.\nOthers\nIn addition to the methods above, screen reader users can also navigate by tables, lists, buttons, forms, links, images, etc.\nImplication:\nUse proper HTML\nsemantic structure\nwith elements marked up appropriately.\nAccommodating Differences Between Screen Readers\nAll screen readers share similar functionality and capabilities. However, keyboard shortcuts, voices, and ways of calling out links, images, and so on, vary between them. Since users will be accustomed to their preferred screen reader\u2019s conventions, these differences don\u2019t typically impact coding practices. The key is to adhere to accessibility standards and generally-accepted accessibility techniques.\nHow Screen Readers Read Content\nIn general:\nScreen readers pause for:\nperiods\nsemi-colons\ncommas\nquestion marks\nexclamation points\nparagraph endings\nScreen readers try to pronounce acronyms, if there are sufficient vowels/consonants to be pronounceable. Otherwise, they spell out the letters.\nNASA\nis pronounced as a word.\nSQL\nis pronounced \u201csequel\u201d even though some humans say \u201cS. Q. L.\u201d\nNSF\nis pronounced \u201cN. S. F.\u201d\nURL\nis pronounced \u201cU. R. L.\u201d\nUsers can pause screen readers and go back to repeat a word or passage. They can even have the screen reader read words letter by letter, with the screen reader shouting/emphasizing the uppercase letters.\nScreen readers read letters out loud as you type them, but say \u201cstar\u201d or \u201casterisk\u201d for password fields.\nScreen readers announce the page title (the\n<title>\nelement in the HTML markup) when first loading a web page.\nScreen readers will read the\nalternative text\nof images, if alt text is present. JAWS precedes the alternative text with the word \u201cgraphic.\u201d If the image is a link, JAWS precedes the alternative text with \u201cgraphic link.\"\nScreen readers ignore images without alternative text and say nothing, but users can set their preferences to read the file name.\nIf an image without alternative text is a link, screen readers will generally read the link destination (the\nhref\nattribute in the HTML markup) or may read the image file name.\nScreen readers announce\nheadings and identify the heading level\n. NVDA and JAWS, for example, precede\n<h1>\nheadings with \u201cheading level 1.\u201d\nSome screen readers announce the number of links on a page as soon as the page finishes loading in the browser.\nJAWS says \u201csame page link\u201d if the link destination is on the same page as the link itself and \u201cvisited link\u201d for links that have been previously accessed.\nScreen readers in table navigation mode inform the user how many rows and columns are in a\ndata table\n.\nUsers can navigate in any direction from cell to cell in table navigation mode. If the table is marked up correctly, the screen reader will read the column and/or row heading as the user enters each new cell.\nScreen readers inform users when they have entered into a form.

For example, the word\nread\ncan be pronounced \u201creed\u201d or \u201cred,\u201d depending on the context: \u201cI\u2019m going to read the newspaper\u201d vs. \u201cI already read the newspaper.\u201d A sentence such as \u201cI read the newspaper every day\u201d is ambiguous to all readers\u2014humans and screen readers alike. The word\ncontent\nis another example: \u201cI feel content\u201d (meaning\nsatisfied\n, with the emphasis on the second syllable [con-\nTENT\n]) vs. \u201cWebAIM.org has some really awesome content\u201d (meaning the\nsubject matter\n, with the emphasis on the first syllable [\nCON\n-tent]).\nScreen readers may or may not read out punctuation, depending on the user\u2019s verbosity setting.
