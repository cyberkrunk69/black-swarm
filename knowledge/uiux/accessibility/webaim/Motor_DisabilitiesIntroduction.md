## "A Lifeline"

![Christopher Reeve](media/christopher_reeve_mit.jpg)

"***[The Internet is] an essential tool. And, literally, a lifeline for many disabled people. I have [Dragon Dictate](/blog/at-experiment-dragon/). And while I was in rehab, I learned to operate it by voice. And I have enjoyed corresponding with friends and strangers with that system. Many disabled people have to spend long hours alone. Voice-activated computers are a means of communication that can prevent a sense of isolation.***"

***– [Christopher Reeve](//www.christopherreeve.org/)***
