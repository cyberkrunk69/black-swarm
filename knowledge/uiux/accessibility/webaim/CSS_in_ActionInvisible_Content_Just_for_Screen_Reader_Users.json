In the vast majority cases, content that is available visually should be available to screen reader users, and vice versa. Verbose cues or instructions that are only read by screen reader users  usually do more harm than good. However, there are a few cases where information or meaning is apparent visually but may not be apparent to screen reader users. In these rare cases, it may be appropriate to cause content to be read by a screen reader, but have the content remain invisible to sighted users.\nTechniques for hiding content\nThere are several mechanisms that can be used for hiding content. It's important that a technique be implemented that results in the desired outcome and accessibility.\ndisplay:none\nor\nvisibility: hidden\nThese styles will hide content from all users. The content is removed from the visual flow of the page and is ignored by screen readers.\nDo not use this CSS if you want the content to be read by a screen reader. But DO use it for content you want hidden from all users.\nhidden\nattribute\nThe HTML\nhidden\nattribute is relatively new and not supported on older browsers like IE11.

All these techniques may result in search engine penalties as they may be interpreted as malicious.\ntext-indent: -10000px;\nThis approach moves the content to the left 10000 pixels - thus off the visible screen. Screen readers will still read text with this style.\nHowever, if a link, form control, or other focusable element is given this style, the element would be focusable, but not visible on the page\u2014sighted keyboard users would likely be confused. This approach\nmay\nbe a viable option if the element does not contain navigable elements, though better techniques are available.\nAbsolutely positioning content off-screen\nThe following are the recommended styles for visually hiding content that will be read by a screen reader.\n.sr-only {\nposition:absolute;\nleft:-10000px;\ntop:auto;\nwidth:1px;\nheight:1px;\noverflow:hidden;\n}\nThe\n.sr-only\nCSS class (\"sr-only\" meaning \"screen reader only\", though the class name does not really matter) should then be referenced from within the tag of the element being hidden, as shown:\n<div\nclass=\"sr-only\"\n>This text is hidden.</div>\nSighted users will not see the hidden content at all\u2014it will be hidden well to the left of the visible browser window. Because it is still part of the page content, screen readers will read it.\nLet's analyze the styles in detail.\nposition:absolute;\ntells the browser to remove the element from the page flow and to begin positioning it.\nleft:-10000px;\nmoves the content 10000 pixels to the left.\ntop:auto;\ntells the browser to position the content vertically at the same location it was originally.\nwidth:1px;\n,\nheight:1px;\nand\noverflow:hidden;\ntell the browser to make the element one pixel in size and to visually hide everything that does not fit into that pixel\u2014this is useful in instances where positioning may be end-user disabled, but all other styles remain enabled.\nNote\nNavigable elements, such as links and form controls, should not be hidden off-screen.

A hidden, associated\n<label>\nelement with \"Search terms\" (or similar) text would ensure that the field is properly identified to screen reader users.\nAnother use case might be page breadcrumbs (such as the \"\nHome\n>\nArticles\n> CSS in Action...\" text near the top of this page). These are a common convention due to their visual location and presentation. Because a screen reader accesses the breadcrumb links and content linearly, it may not be readily apparent to them that it is breadcrumbs. As such, hidden text of \"You are here:\" has been added just prior to the breadcrumbs to provide a cue/indicator to screen reader users about what follows.\n\"Skip\" links\n\"Skip to main content\" or \"Skip navigation\" links\nare one of the few places where accessibility has a potentially negative impact on visual design and usability for some users. To be useful, the \"skip\" link should be one of the first on the page. Designers may balk at the idea of providing such a prominent link\u2014particularly when that link will not be used by most site visitors. However, hiding the \"skip\" link visually using a technique above makes it much less usable to sighted keyboard users\u2014a user group that can greatly benefit from this link.\nOne way to reconcile this conflict is to visually hide the link until the user tabs to it at which point it becomes visible to sighted users.\nThis technique uses two style definitions\u2014one to visually hide the link, and another using the\na:focus\npseudo-class to visually reveal the link while it has focus.\n#skip a\n{\nposition:absolute;\nleft:-10000px;\ntop:auto;\nwidth:1px;\nheight:1px;\noverflow:hidden;\n}\n#skip a:focus\n{\nposition:static;\nwidth:auto;\nheight:auto;\n}\nThese styles should then be applied to the \"skip\" link:\n<div id=\"skip\"><a href=\"#content\">Skip to Main Content</a></div>\nOne possible drawback to this approach is that the sudden appearance of a link that was previously invisible will be unexpected and could potentially confuse the sighted keyboard user. The WebAIM.org site address this by implementing CSS transitions to animate the focused \"skip\" link from above the top of the page (as opposed to off-screen left) to the top left corner of the page, then back above the page when focus is lost.

It's important that a technique be implemented that results in the desired outcome and accessibility.\n\n### `display:none` or `visibility: hidden`\n\nThese styles will hide content from all users. The content is removed from the visual flow of the page and is ignored by screen readers. **Do not use this CSS if you want the content to be read by a screen reader. But DO use it for content you want hidden from all users.**\n\n### `hidden` attribute\n\nThe HTML `hidden` attribute is relatively new and not supported on older browsers like IE11. When supported, it functions the same as CSS `display:none`\u2014elements with this attribute will not be presented to any user.\n\n### `width:0px`, `height:0px` or other 0 pixel sizing techniques (not recommended)\n\nAn element with no height or width, whether defined in HTML or CSS, is typically removed from the flow of the page, so most screen readers will not read it. **Do not size content to 0 pixels if you want the content to be read by a screen reader.** Content styled with `font-size:0px` or `line-height:0` may work, though the elements would still take horizontal space on the screen. All these techniques may result in search engine penalties as they may be interpreted as malicious.\n\n### `text-indent: -10000px;`\n\nThis approach moves the content to the left 10000 pixels - thus off the visible screen. Screen readers will still read text with this style.\n\nHowever, if a link, form control, or other focusable element is given this style, the element would be focusable, but not visible on the page\u2014sighted keyboard users would likely be confused. This approach *may* be a viable option if the element does not contain navigable elements, though better techniques are available.\n\n### Absolutely positioning content off-screen\n\nThe following are the recommended styles for visually hiding content that will be read by a screen reader.\n\n.sr-only {  \nposition:absolute;  \nleft:-10000px;  \ntop:auto;  \nwidth:1px;  \nheight:1px;  \noverflow:hidden;  \n}\n\nThe `.sr-only` CSS class (\"sr-only\" meaning \"screen reader only\", though the class name does not really matter) should then be referenced from within the tag of the element being hidden, as shown:\n\n<div **class=\"sr-only\"**>This text is hidden.</div>\n\nSighted users will not see the hidden content at all\u2014it will be hidden well to the left of the visible browser window. Because it is still part of the page content, screen readers will read it.\n\nLet's analyze the styles in detail. `position:absolute;` tells the browser to remove the element from the page flow and to begin positioning it. `left:-10000px;` moves the content 10000 pixels to the left. `top:auto;` tells the browser to position the content vertically at the same location it was originally. `width:1px;`, `height:1px;` and `overflow:hidden;` tell the browser to make the element one pixel in size and to visually hide everything that does not fit into that pixel\u2014this is useful in instances where positioning may be end-user disabled, but all other styles remain enabled.\n\nNote\n\nNavigable elements, such as links and form controls, should not be hidden off-screen.

A hidden, associated `<label>` element with \"Search terms\" (or similar) text would ensure that the field is properly identified to screen reader users.\n\nAnother use case might be page breadcrumbs (such as the \"[Home](/) > [Articles](/articles/) > CSS in Action...\" text near the top of this page).
