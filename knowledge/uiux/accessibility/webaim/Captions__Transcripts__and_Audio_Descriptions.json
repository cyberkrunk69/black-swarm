Most countries require most pre-recorded and live television programs to be closed-captioned.\nClosed captioning of most pre-recorded television programs is now a legal requirement in most countries. Most live broadcasts (such as news and sports events) and most pre-recorded programs now include closed captions that can be easily enabled and viewed on screen.\nCaptions as seen on DVD or Blu-ray\nOn broadcast television, the style and location of the captions depend on the caption decoder built into the viewer's television receiver or streaming device. In online or streaming video, the browser or video player determines how captions will be displayed. Many decoders and video players allow the user to customize caption size, color, font, and location on the screen.\nCaptions as seen in a web media player\nOpen captions include the same content as closed captions, but the captions are a permanent part of the video picture and cannot be turned off. The captions are visible to anybody viewing the video clip.

Beyond the spoken words, a transcript should include descriptions of important audio information (like laughter) and visual information (such as someone entering the room). Transcripts help deaf/blind users interact with content using refreshable Braille devices.\nTranscripts also allow anyone that cannot access content from either web audio or video (or both) to read a text transcript instead. For most web video, both captions and a text transcript should be provided. For content that is audio only, a transcript will usually suffice\u2014captions are not necessary for audio-only media like a podcast.\nTranscripts make multimedia content searchable by search engines and users. Screen reader users also may also prefer a transcript over real-time audio, since most proficient screen reader users set their assistive technology to read at a rate much faster than natural human speech.\nImportant\nIn order to be optimally accessible to users with auditory disabilities, web multimedia should include both synchronized captions and a transcript.\nAudio Descriptions\nImportant\nVisual content within multimedia must be described via audio in order for the multimedia to be optimally accessible to users with visual disabilities.\nAudio descriptions help users with visual disabilities perceive content that is presented only visually, and are necessary for WCAG 2 Level AA conformance. On television, this is often called Descriptive Video Service (DVS). Typically, a narrator describes the visual-only content in the multimedia. Audio descriptions can be provided with the primary video, or in another audio track, or via an alternate version of the video that includes audio descriptions.\nHere's a short example of an audio description that you might recognize.\nCan you visualize what is being described?\nProducing audio descriptions can be expensive and time-consuming. However, they are unnecessary if the audio already presents the necessary visual content. If a video displays a list of five important items, the items should be read aloud instead of the audio presenting, \"As you can see, there are five important points\".
