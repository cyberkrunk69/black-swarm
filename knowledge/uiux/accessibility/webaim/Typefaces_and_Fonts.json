Fonts are sub-sets of typefaces that have a consistent appearance, such as a 14 point and bold font in the Arial typeface. Typography\u2014how typefaces and fonts present text\u2014is very impactful on reading, which is a core component of visual accessibility.\nThis article primarily focuses on typefaces and fonts. To learn more about other aspects of typography and layout, please see\nText/Typographical Layout\n.\nTypeface Readability\nWhen reading text, most people do not read or parse individual characters or even words. Instead, the eye quickly scans through text and parses patterns and groups of characters (typically 6-9 characters at a time) which are nearly instantaneously converted into meaning by the human brain. This subconscious process allows us to read and understand text content very quickly with high degrees of understanding, even though we aren't even seeing or thinking of characters and words.\nIt is only when characters or words are unfamiliar or introduce a barrier to that direct pattern-to-meaning process that we must pause to more closely examine or process characters or words. For optimal readability and understandability, the key is to avoid those interruptions.\nSome principles to consider:\nUse simple, familiar, and easily-parsed fonts.\nAvoid character complexity\nAvoid character ambiguity\nUse a limited number of typefaces, fonts, and font variations.\nConsider spacing and weight.\nEnsure sufficient, but not too much, contrast between the text and the background.\nAvoid small font sizes and other anti-patterns.\nUse simple, familiar, and easily-parsed fonts\nSimple, familiar typefaces are easiest to parse and read because the mind already has or can quickly generate a model for the shapes and patterns of text. Unfamiliar or complex typefaces require additional time and orientation, resulting in character or word parsing (which is slow and cognitively intense) rather than pattern/block parsing (which is fast and less burdensome).\nThere is not a\nbest\ntypeface or font.\nExperts  disagree on which typefaces provide the best readability. Some people indicate that sans-serif fonts are better for viewing on a screen and serif fonts are better for print, but this is becoming less of a concern due to the prevalence of high resolution displays and higher quality typefaces. Regardless, simplicity in typefaces is critical. The typeface should be familiar or easily-parsed so that it quickly becomes familiar. Many common and standard fonts available in modern operating systems meet these requirements.\nSimilarly, there is not one typeface that will be optimal for all users with dyslexia.\nTypefaces should be chosen to align with the tone, messaging, and brand of the content. A cartoon font used on a bank web site, for example, would likely undermine the sense of trust and professionalism the user expects. Consider the differences between these two logos with the same text, but different typefaces.\nWhich of these banks would you trust more with your money?\nAvoid character complexity\nSimpler shapes and patterns of typographical text are more quickly and accurately analyzed by the human mind. Be careful with complex fonts, especially for long sections of text.\nAvoid character ambiguity\nWhen glyphs or characters within a typeface appear similar to another, this can introduce ambiguity which must be processed by the brain, thus impacting reading speed and understanding.\nThe texts above illustrate common ambiguities. The capital letters \"C\" and \"O\" and lowercase letters \"e\" and \"o\" in the Arial typeface look very similar due to the very narrow opening in the letters. This is contrasted with the wider opening and more distinct differences between \"C\" and \"O\" and \"e\" and \"o\" in the Open Sans typeface.\nSimilarly, capital \"I\", lowercase \"l\", and numeral \"1\" appear almost identical in Gill Sans, but are much more easily distinguished from each other in Verdana. Even though Verdana is a bit more complex, this minor complexity helps with disambiguation of characters.\nUse a limited number of typefaces, fonts, and font variations\nEach time you encounter a new typeface, font, or font variation, your mind must build a map or model of the characters and patterns to then more quickly parse words and process meaning. This requires cognitive effort and time. If the typeface is already familiar, this overhead is reduced.\nBe cautious when using multiple typefaces in the same document or web page. Ensure that typefaces/fonts align with types of content, such as one typeface or font for headings and another for body text.\nConsider spacing and weight\nAdequate letter and word spacing can improve readability by providing greater separation and clarity between adjacent characters and words. When letters or words appear very close to each other, confusion can be introduced.\nAdditionally, the weight (meaning the thickness of the glyphs) can also impact perceivability and readability.\nWCAG Text Spacing\nWCAG requires that no loss of content or functionality occurs when the end user overrides page styles for paragraph spacing to 200% of the font size, text line height/spacing to 150% of the font size, word spacing to 16% of the font size, and letter spacing to 12% of the font size. Ensure that your page text can be modified without it disappearing or overlapping other page content.\nEnsure sufficient, but not too much, contrast between the text and the background\nText is much easier to read when there is a sufficient contrast or brightness difference between the text and the background. The\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines\ndefine measures for sufficient text contrast. Tools such as\nWebAIM's Color Contrast Checker\nmake it easy to check contrast  and determine WCAG compliance.\nBlack text on a white background is the default for web content, but this combination can feel stark and fatiguing, especially for long sections of text. Too much contrast may introduce halos or echos of text characters which can impact readability, especially for some with dyslexia. While WCAG does not have a maximum contrast threshold, you may want to style text with slightly lower contrast. This page, for example, uses a very dark grey body text color on white for slightly reduced contrast.\nAvoid small font sizes and other anti-patterns.\nIn addition to text spacing, weight, and contrast, the size of text has a significant impact on readability. Although WCAG has no minimum font size requirement, it is still a valid usability consideration.\nRelative font sizes (such as percents or ems) provide more flexibility in modifying the visual presentation compared to absolute units (such as pixels or points).\nThe font size chosen also impacts line length\u2014the number of characters that appear per line. Line length and other text layout considerations are covered in WebAIM's\nText/Typographical Layout article\n.\nBe careful with longer sections of text that are entirely bold, italicized, capitalized, or styled in atypical ways. These font variations can make text more difficult to read\u2014and each new variation requires some orientation by the user.\nReal Text vs. Text Within Graphics\nReal text provides many advantages over text within images. When content is presented as real text\u2014meaning rendered a text characters in a web page\u2014it is very adaptable. The user can customize it for better readability, such as by adjusting the line, word, and character spacing, changing the font face, changing text colors, increasing the text size without loss of fidelity, and translating to other languages. Additionally, true text can be copied and pasted, adapts to various screen sizes, is more compatible with search engines and low bandwidth environments, etc.\nWhen text is instead defined within an image, it loses most of that adaptability. The\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines\nrequire that\nif the same visual presentation can be made using text alone, an image is not used to present that text.\nText within images can become more pixelated, blocky, and difficult to read when enlarged, such as may be necessary by users with some visual disabilities.\nExample\nThe enlarged image of the word \"University\" above is difficult to read because it has become pixelated.\nEmbedded fonts\nModern browsers allow font embedding, a CSS technique that allows the browser to download fonts and then display text in those font faces. While most system-level typefaces are designed for some level of readability, many custom-designed typefaces are not. Care should be taken to use typefaces and fonts that maintain high levels of readability. Simply changing the font face has no impact on screen reader or other types of accessibility, so long as the actual underlying text is maintained in an accessible format.",

A cartoon font used on a bank web site, for example, would likely undermine the sense of trust and professionalism the user expects. Consider the differences between these two logos with the same text, but different typefaces.\n\n![Two logos with text of WebAIM Bank and Trust. We take your money seriously. We promise! The first uses a chalkboard and cartoonish font. The second uses sans-serif fonts that are more common to bank logos.](media/WebAIMbank.png)\n\nWhich of these banks would you trust more with your money?\n\n### Avoid character complexity\n\nSimpler shapes and patterns of typographical text are more quickly and accurately analyzed by the human mind. Be careful with complex fonts, especially for long sections of text.\n\n![An illustration of a complex, decorative typeface vs a simpler, serif typeface.](media/complexvssimple.png)\n\n### Avoid character ambiguity\n\nWhen glyphs or characters within a typeface appear similar to another, this can introduce ambiguity which must be processed by the brain, thus impacting reading speed and understanding.\n\n![An illustration of letter C vs O in different typefaces.](media/ambiguity.png)\n\nThe texts above illustrate common ambiguities. The capital letters \"C\" and \"O\" and lowercase letters \"e\" and \"o\" in the Arial typeface look very similar due to the very narrow opening in the letters. This is contrasted with the wider opening and more distinct differences between \"C\" and \"O\" and \"e\" and \"o\" in the Open Sans typeface.\n\n![An illustration of capital I vs lowercase l vs number 1 in different typefaces.](media/ambiguity2.png)\n\nSimilarly, capital \"I\", lowercase \"l\", and numeral \"1\" appear almost identical in Gill Sans, but are much more easily distinguished from each other in Verdana.

This requires cognitive effort and time. If the typeface is already familiar, this overhead is reduced.\n\n![An illustration showing the words 'Each new typeface introduces additional cognitive overhead' in multiple typefaces.](media/multiple.png)\n\nBe cautious when using multiple typefaces in the same document or web page. Ensure that typefaces/fonts align with types of content, such as one typeface or font for headings and another for body text.\n\n### Consider spacing and weight\n\nAdequate letter and word spacing can improve readability by providing greater separation and clarity between adjacent characters and words. When letters or words appear very close to each other, confusion can be introduced.\n\n![An illustration showing very closely spaced characters. Is the word 'cod' or 'cool'?](media/spacing.png)\n\nAdditionally, the weight (meaning the thickness of the glyphs) can also impact perceivability and readability.\n\n![An illustration over a very thin/light font weight compared to standard font weight.](media/weight.png)\n\nWCAG Text Spacing\n\nWCAG requires that no loss of content or functionality occurs when the end user overrides page styles for paragraph spacing to 200% of the font size, text line height/spacing to 150% of the font size, word spacing to 16% of the font size, and letter spacing to 12% of the font size.
