You can start with simple prop-based animations before growing to layout, gesture and scroll animations.\n\nMotion's unique **hybrid engine** combines the performance of native browser animations with the flexibility of JavaScript. It's also trusted by companies like [Framer](https://framer.com) and [Figma](https://figma.com) to power their amazing no-code animations and gestures.\n\nIn this guide, we'll learn **why** and **when** you should use Motion, how to **install** it, and then take a whirlwind tour of its main features.\n\n## [Why Motion for React?](#why-motion-for-react)\n\nReact gives you the power to build dynamic user interfaces, but orchestrating complex, performant animations can be a challenge. Motion is a production-ready library designed to solve this, making it simple to create everything from beautiful micro-interactions to complex, gesture-driven animations.\n\n```\n<motion.button animate={{ opacity: 1 }} />\n```\n\n### [Key advantages](#key-advantages)\n\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the right choice for your project.\n\n- **Built for React.** While other animation libraries are messy to integrate, Motion's declarative API feels like a natural extension of React. Animations can be linked directly to state and props.\n- **Hardware-acceleration.** Motion leverages the same high-performance browser animations as pure CSS, ensuring your UIs stay smooth and snappy. You get the power of 120fps animations with a much simpler and more expressive API.\n- **Animate anything.** CSS has hard limits. There's values you can't animate, keyframes you can't interrupt, staggers that must be hardcoded. Motion provides a single, consistent API that handles everything from simple transitions to advanced scroll, layout, and gesture-driven effects.\n- **App-like gestures.** Standard CSS `:hover` events are unreliable on touch devices. Motion provides robust, cross-device gesture recognisers for tap, drag, and hover, making it easy to build interactions that feel native and intuitive on any device.\n\n### [When is CSS a better choice?](#when-is-css-a-better-choice)\n\nFor simple, self-contained effects (like a color change on hover) a standard CSS transition is a lightweight solution. The strength of Motion is that it can do these simple kinds of animations but also scale to anything you can imagine. All with the same easy to write and maintain API.\n\n## [Install](#install)\n\nMotion is available via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/motion):\n\n```\nnpm install motion\n```\n\nFeatures can now be imported via `\"motion/react\"`:\n\n```\nimport { motion } from \"motion/react\"\n```\n\nPrefer to install via CDN, or looking for framework-specific instructions? Check out our [full installation guide](./react-installation).\n\n## [Your first animation](#your-first-animation)\n\nThe `<motion />` component is the core API in Motion for React. It's a DOM element, supercharged with animation capabilities.\n\n```\n<motion.ul animate={{ rotate: 360 }} />\n```\n\nWhen values in `animate` change, the component will animate. Motion has intuitive defaults, but animations can of course be configured via [the](./react-transitions) `transition` [prop](./react-transitions).\n\n```\n<motion.div\n  animate={{\n    scale: 2,\n    transition: { duration: 2 }\n  }}\n/>\n```\n\n[Learn more about React animation](./react-animation)\n\n## [Enter animation](#enter-animation)\n\nWhen a component enters the page, it will automatically animate to the values defined in the `animate` prop.\n\nYou can provide values to animate from via the `initial` prop (otherwise these will be read from the DOM).\n\n```\n<motion.button initial={{ scale: 0 }} animate={{ scale: 1 }} />\n```\n\nOr disable this initial animation entirely by setting `initial` to `false`.\n\n```\n<motion.button initial={false} animate={{ scale: 1 }} />\n```\n\n## [Hover & tap animation](#hover-tap-animation)\n\n`<motion />` extends React's event system with powerful [gesture animations](./react-gestures). It currently supports hover, tap, focus, and drag.\n\n```\n<motion.button\n  whileHover={{ scale: 1.1 }}\n  whileTap={{ scale: 0.95 }}\n  onHoverStart={() => console.log('hover started!')}\n/>\n```\n\nMotion's gestures are designed to feel better than using CSS or JavaScript events alone.\n\n## [Scroll animation](#scroll-animation)\n\nMotion supports both types of [scroll animations](./react-scroll-animations): **Scroll-triggered** and **scroll-linked**.\n\nTo trigger an animation on scroll, the `whileInView` prop defines a state to animate to/from when an element enters/leaves the viewport:\n\n```\n<motion.div\n  initial={{ backgroundColor: \"rgb(0, 255, 0)\", opacity: 0 }}\n  whileInView={{ backgroundColor: \"rgb(255, 0, 0)\", opacity: 1 }}\n/>\n```\n\nWhereas to link a value directly to scroll position, it's possible to use `MotionValue`s via `useScroll`.\n\n```\nconst { scrollYProgress } = useScroll()\n\nreturn <motion.div style={{ scaleX: scrollYProgress }} />\n```\n\n## [Layout animation](#layout-animation)\n\nMotion has an industry-leading [layout animation](./react-layout-animations) engine that supports animating between changes in layout using transforms.\n\nIt's as easy as applying the `layout` prop.\n\n```\n<motion.div layout />\n```\n\nOr to animate between completely different elements, a `layoutId`:\n\n```\n<motion.div layoutId=\"underline\" />\n```\n\n## [Exit animations](#exit-animations)\n\nBy wrapping `motion` components with `<AnimatePresence>` we gain access to [exit animations](./react-animate-presence). This allows us to animate elements as they're removed from the DOM.\n\n```\n<AnimatePresence>\n  {show ? <motion.div key=\"box\" exit={{ opacity: 0 }} /> : null}\n</AnimatePresence>\n```\n\n## [Development tools](#development-tools)\n\n[Motion Studio](../studio) provides visual and AI animation editing directly inside your code editor.

Each comes complete with full source code that you can copy-paste into your project.\n\n**Motion for React** is a React animation library for building smooth, production-grade UI animations. You can start with simple prop-based animations before growing to layout, gesture and scroll animations.\n\nMotion's unique **hybrid engine** combines the performance of native browser animations with the flexibility of JavaScript. It's also trusted by companies like [Framer](https://framer.com) and [Figma](https://figma.com) to power their amazing no-code animations and gestures.\n\nIn this guide, we'll learn **why** and **when** you should use Motion, how to **install** it, and then take a whirlwind tour of its main features.\n\n## [Why Motion for React?](#why-motion-for-react)\n\nReact gives you the power to build dynamic user interfaces, but orchestrating complex, performant animations can be a challenge. Motion is a production-ready library designed to solve this, making it simple to create everything from beautiful micro-interactions to complex, gesture-driven animations.\n\n```\n<motion.button animate={{ opacity: 1 }} />\n```\n\n### [Key advantages](#key-advantages)\n\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the right choice for your project.\n\n- **Built for React.** While other animation libraries are messy to integrate, Motion's declarative API feels like a natural extension of React. Animations can be linked directly to state and props.\n- **Hardware-acceleration.** Motion leverages the same high-performance browser animations as pure CSS, ensuring your UIs stay smooth and snappy. You get the power of 120fps animations with a much simpler and more expressive API.\n- **Animate anything.** CSS has hard limits. There's values you can't animate, keyframes you can't interrupt, staggers that must be hardcoded. Motion provides a single, consistent API that handles everything from simple transitions to advanced scroll, layout, and gesture-driven effects.\n- **App-like gestures.** Standard CSS `:hover` events are unreliable on touch devices. Motion provides robust, cross-device gesture recognisers for tap, drag, and hover, making it easy to build interactions that feel native and intuitive on any device.\n\n### [When is CSS a better choice?](#when-is-css-a-better-choice)\n\nFor simple, self-contained effects (like a color change on hover) a standard CSS transition is a lightweight solution. The strength of Motion is that it can do these simple kinds of animations but also scale to anything you can imagine. All with the same easy to write and maintain API.\n\n## [Install](#install)\n\nMotion is available via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/motion):\n\n```\nnpm install motion\n```\n\nFeatures can now be imported via `\"motion/react\"`:\n\n```\nimport { motion } from \"motion/react\"\n```\n\nPrefer to install via CDN, or looking for framework-specific instructions? Check out our [full installation guide](./react-installation).\n\n## [Your first animation](#your-first-animation)\n\nThe `<motion />` component is the core API in Motion for React. It's a DOM element, supercharged with animation capabilities.\n\n```\n<motion.ul animate={{ rotate: 360 }} />\n```\n\nWhen values in `animate` change, the component will animate. Motion has intuitive defaults, but animations can of course be configured via [the](./react-transitions) `transition` [prop](./react-transitions).\n\n```\n<motion.div\n  animate={{\n    scale: 2,\n    transition: { duration: 2 }\n  }}\n/>\n```\n\n[Learn more about React animation](./react-animation)\n\n## [Enter animation](#enter-animation)\n\nWhen a component enters the page, it will automatically animate to the values defined in the `animate` prop.\n\nYou can provide values to animate from via the `initial` prop (otherwise these will be read from the DOM).\n\n```\n<motion.button initial={{ scale: 0 }} animate={{ scale: 1 }} />\n```\n\nOr disable this initial animation entirely by setting `initial` to `false`.\n\n```\n<motion.button initial={false} animate={{ scale: 1 }} />\n```\n\n## [Hover & tap animation](#hover-tap-animation)\n\n`<motion />` extends React's event system with powerful [gesture animations](./react-gestures). It currently supports hover, tap, focus, and drag.\n\n```\n<motion.button\n  whileHover={{ scale: 1.1 }}\n  whileTap={{ scale: 0.95 }}\n  onHoverStart={() => console.log('hover started!')}\n/>\n```\n\nMotion's gestures are designed to feel better than using CSS or JavaScript events alone.\n\n## [Scroll animation](#scroll-animation)\n\nMotion supports both types of [scroll animations](./react-scroll-animations): **Scroll-triggered** and **scroll-linked**.\n\nTo trigger an animation on scroll, the `whileInView` prop defines a state to animate to/from when an element enters/leaves the viewport:\n\n```\n<motion.div\n  initial={{ backgroundColor: \"rgb(0, 255, 0)\", opacity: 0 }}\n  whileInView={{ backgroundColor: \"rgb(255, 0, 0)\", opacity: 1 }}\n/>\n```\n\nWhereas to link a value directly to scroll position, it's possible to use `MotionValue`s via `useScroll`.\n\n```\nconst { scrollYProgress } = useScroll()\n\nreturn <motion.div style={{ scaleX: scrollYProgress }} />\n```\n\n## [Layout animation](#layout-animation)\n\nMotion has an industry-leading [layout animation](./react-layout-animations) engine that supports animating between changes in layout using transforms.\n\nIt's as easy as applying the `layout` prop.\n\n```\n<motion.div layout />\n```\n\nOr to animate between completely different elements, a `layoutId`:\n\n```\n<motion.div layoutId=\"underline\" />\n```\n\n## [Exit animations](#exit-animations)\n\nBy wrapping `motion` components with `<AnimatePresence>` we gain access to [exit animations](./react-animate-presence). This allows us to animate elements as they're removed from the DOM.\n\n```\n<AnimatePresence>\n  {show ? <motion.div key=\"box\" exit={{ opacity: 0 }} /> : null}\n</AnimatePresence>\n```\n\n## [Development tools](#development-tools)\n\n[Motion Studio](../studio) provides visual and AI animation editing directly inside your code editor. Enhance your workflow tools like the Codex, an AI-searchable examples database, CSS spring generation, a CSS and Motion bezier editor, and more.\n\n### Install Motion Studio\n\nOne-click install for Cursor:\n\n[Add Extension](cursor:extension/motion.motion-vscode-extension)\n\n[Add MCP](https://cursor.com/en-US/install-mcp?name=motion&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IC15IGh0dHBzOi8vYXBpLm1vdGlvbi5kZXYvcmVnaXN0cnkudGd6P3BhY2thZ2U9bW90aW9uLXN0dWRpby1tY3AmdmVyc2lvbj1sYXRlc3QifQ%3D%3D)\n\nMotion Studio is also compatible with VS Code, Google Antigravity and more.
