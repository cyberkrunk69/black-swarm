Variants will flow down through children as normal.\n\n```\n<motion.button\n  whileTap=\"tap\"\n  whileHover=\"hover\"\n  variants={buttonVariants}\n>\n  <svg>\n    <motion.path variants={iconVariants} />\n  </svg>\n</motion.button>\n```\n\n## [Gestures](#gestures)\n\n### [Hover](#hover)\n\nThe hover gesture detects when a pointer hovers over or leaves a component. [Learn more about hover animations.](./react-hover-animation)\n\n```\n<motion.a\n  whileHover={{ scale: 1.2 }}\n  onHoverStart={event => {}}\n  onHoverEnd={event => {}}\n/>\n```\n\n### [Tap](#tap)\n\nThe tap gesture detects when the **primary pointer** (like a left click or first touch point) presses down and releases on the same component.\n\n```\n<motion.button whileTap={{ scale: 0.9, rotate: 3 }} />\n```\n\nIt will fire a `tap` event when the tap or click ends on the same component it started on, and a `tapCancel` event if the tap or click ends outside the component.\n\nIf the tappable component is a child of a draggable component, it'll automatically cancel the tap gesture if the pointer moves further than 3 pixels during the gesture.\n\n#### [Accessibility](#accessibility)\n\nElements with tap events are keyboard-accessible.\n\nAny element with a tap prop will be able to receive focus and `Enter` can be used to trigger tap events on focused elements.\n\n- Pressing `Enter` down will trigger `onTapStart` and `whileTap`\n- Releasing `Enter` will trigger `onTap`\n- If the element loses focus before `Enter` is released, `onTapCancel` will fire.\n\n### [Pan](#pan)\n\nThe pan gesture recognises when a pointer presses down on a component and moves further than 3 pixels. The pan gesture is ended when the pointer is released.\n\n```\n<motion.div onPan={(e, pointInfo) => {}} />\n```\n\nPan doesn't currently have an associated `while-` prop.\n\nFor pan gestures to work correctly with touch input, the element needs touch scrolling to be disabled on either x/y or both axis with the `touch-action` CSS rule.\n\n### [Drag](#drag)\n\nThe drag gesture applies pointer movement to the x and/or y axis of the component.\n\n```\n<motion.div drag whileDrag={{ scale: 1.2, backgroundColor: \"#f00\" }} />\n```\n\n[Learn more about drag animations](./react-drag).\n\n### [Focus](#focus)\n\nThe focus gesture detects when a component gains or loses focus by the same rules as the [CSS :focus-visible selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible).\n\nTypically, this is when an `input` receives focus by any means, and when other elements receive focus by accessible means (like via keyboard navigation).\n\n```\n<motion.a whileFocus={{ scale: 1.2 }} href=\"#\" />\n```\n\n## [Event propagation](#event-propagation)\n\nChildren can stop pointer events propagating to parent `motion` components using the `Capture` React props.\n\nFor instance, a child can stop drag and tap gestures and their related `while` animations from firing on parents by passing `e.stopPropagation()` to `onPointerDownCapture`.\n\n```\n<motion.div whileTap={{ scale: 2 }}>\n  <button onPointerDownCapture={e => e.stopPropagation()} />\n</motion.div>\n```\n\n## [Note: SVG filters](#note-svg-filters)\n\nGestures aren't recognised on SVG `filter` components, as these elements don't have a physical presence and therefore don't receive events.\n\nYou can instead add `while-` props and event handlers to a parent and use variants to animate these elements.\n\n```\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <motion.svg whileHover=\"hover\">\n      <filter id=\"blur\">\n        <motion.feGaussianBlur\n          stdDeviation={0}\n          variants={{ hover: { stdDeviation: 2 } }}\n        />\n      </filter>\n    </motion.svg>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Related topics\n\n- [### useDragControls\n\n  Manually start/stop drag gestures.
