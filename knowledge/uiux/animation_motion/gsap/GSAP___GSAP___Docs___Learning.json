It's just a generic object with various methods and properties that create and control [Tweens](/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween) and [Timelines](/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline), two of the most important concepts to understand.\n\nQuick Overview\n\nFor a quick overview of the GSAP object, check out this video from the [\"GSAP 3 Express\" course](https://courses.snorkl.tv/courses/gsap-3-express?ref=44f484) by Snorkl.tv - one of the best ways to learn the basics.\n\nTo get the most out of GSAP, it's crucial that you understand what Tweens and Timelines are:\n\n### What's a Tween?[\u00e2\u0080\u008b](#whats-a-tween \"Direct link to What's a Tween?\")\n\nA [Tween](/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween) is what does all the animation work - think of it like a **high-performance property setter**. You feed in targets (the objects you want to animate), a duration, and any properties you want it to animate and then when the Tween's playhead moves to a new position, figures out what the property values should be at that point applies them accordingly.\n\n#### Common methods for creating a Tween:[\u00e2\u0080\u008b](#common-methods-for-creating-a-tween \"Direct link to Common methods for creating a Tween:\")\n\n- [gsap.to()](/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.to())\n- [gsap.from()](/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.from())\n- [gsap.fromTo()](/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.fromTo())\n\nFor simple animations (no fancy sequencing), the methods above are all you need! For example:\n\n```\n//rotate and move elements with a class of \"box\" (\"x\" is a shortcut for a translateX() transform) over the course of 1 second.  \ngsap.to(\".box\", { rotation: 27, x: 100, duration: 1 });\n```\n\n#### loading...\n\nYou can do basic sequencing by using the `delay` special property, but Timelines make sequencing and complex choreography much, much easier.\n\n### What's a Timeline?[\u00e2\u0080\u008b](#whats-a-timeline \"Direct link to What's a Timeline?\")\n\nA [Timeline](/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline) is a **container for Tweens.** It's the ultimate sequencing tool that lets you position animations in time wherever you want and then control the whole sequence easily with methods like [pause()](/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline/pause()), [play()](/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline/play()), [progress()](/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline/progress()), [reverse()](/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline/reverse()), [timeScale()](/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline/timeScale()), etc.\n\nCreate as many Timelines as you want. You can even **nest them** which is fantastic for modularizing your animation code! Every animation (Tween and Timeline) gets placed onto a parent timeline (the [globalTimeline](/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.globalTimeline()) by default). Moving a Timeline's playhead cascades down through its children so that the playheads stay aligned. A Timeline is purely about grouping things and coordinating time/playheads - it never actually sets properties on targets (Tweens handle that).\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2blueSpin\n\n3\n\n4\n\nPlay\n\n#### Method for creating a Timeline:[\u00e2\u0080\u008b](#method-for-creating-a-timeline \"Direct link to Method for creating a Timeline:\")\n\n- [gsap.timeline()](/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.timeline())\n\nGSAP's API lets you control virtually anything on-the-fly, such as the playhead position, the [startTime](/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/startTime()) of any child, even play/pause/reverse the timeline or alter the timeScale itself.\n\n## Sequencing[\u00e2\u0080\u008b](#sequencing \"Direct link to Sequencing\")\n\nFirst, create a Timeline:\n\n```\nvar tl = gsap.timeline();\n```\n\nThen add a tween using one of the convenience methods - [to()](/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline/to()), [from()](/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline/from()), or [fromTo()](/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline/fromTo()):\n\n```\ntl.to(\".box\", { duration: 2, x: 100, opacity: 0.5 });\n```\n\nDo that as many times as you want. Notice we're calling `.to()` **on the timeline instance** (the variable `tl` in this case), not the `gsap` object. This creates a tween and immediately puts it into that particular Timeline. `gsap.to()`, on the other hand, creates a standalone tween. By default, the animations will be sequenced one-after-the-other. You can even use method chaining to simplify your code like this:\n\n```\n//sequenced one-after-the-other  \ntl.to(\".box1\", { duration: 2, x: 100 }) //notice that there's no semicolon!  \n  .to(\".box2\", { duration: 1, y: 200 })  \n  .to(\".box3\", { duration: 3, rotation: 360 });\n```\n\n#### loading...\n\ninfo\n\nThe whole GSAP platform is object-oriented and you could create individual tween instances with [gsap.to()](/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.to()), for example, and then [timeline.add()](/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline/add()) each one but it's just easier to call .to(), .from(), or .fromTo() directly on the Timeline instance to do the same thing in fewer steps.\n\n## Positioning[\u00e2\u0080\u008b](#positioning \"Direct link to Positioning\")\n\nDefine **exactly** where you want your animations to be placed into the timeline by using the optional [position parameter](/resources/position-parameter/). A number indicates an absolute time (in seconds), or a string with a `\"+=\"` or `\"-=\"` prefix indicates an offset relative to the END of the timeline. For example, `\"+=2\"` would be 2 seconds after the end, creating a 2-second gap. `\"-=2\"` would create a 2-second overlap.\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2blueSpin\n\n3\n\n4\n\nPlay\n\n### Labels[\u00e2\u0080\u008b](#labels \"Direct link to Labels\")\n\nUse labels to mark certain spots on the timeline so that you can place animations there or navigate there during playback.\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2blueSpin\n\n3\n\n4\n\nPlay\n\n```\n//add a label at exactly 3 seconds  \ntl.addLabel(\"step2\", 3)  \n  \n//then later, we can seek() to that spot:  \ntl.seek(\"step2\");\n```\n\n## Control methods[\u00e2\u0080\u008b](#control-methods \"Direct link to Control methods\")\n\n[Tween](/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween) and [Timeline](/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline) both extend an Animation class that exposes a myriad of useful methods and properties. Here are some of the most frequently used:\n\n```\npause()  \nplay()  \nprogress()  \nrestart()  \nresume()  \nreverse()  \nseek()  \ntime()  \nduration()  \ntimeScale()  \nkill()\n```\n\n#### loading...\n\nReference the Tween or Timeline instance with a variable, and then control it whenever you want:\n\n```\n//you only need to create a variable if you want to control it later...  \nvar tween = gsap.to(...);  \nvar tl = gsap.timeline(); //\"tl\" short for timeline  \ntl.to(...).to(...); //add animations.  \n  \n//now we can control them...  \ntween.pause();  \ntween.timeScale(2); //double speed  \ntl.seek(3); //jump to 3 seconds in  \ntl.progress(0.5); //halfway through  \n...\n```\n\n## Contents\n\n- [What's a Tween?](#whats-a-tween)\n- [What's a Timeline?](#whats-a-timeline)\n- [Sequencing](#sequencing)\n- [Positioning](#positioning)\n  - [Labels](#labels)\n- [Control methods](#control-methods)",
