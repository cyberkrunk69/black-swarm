# Vivarium

Vivarium is a local-first, multi-resident runtime with a human control panel.

Core focus right now: **MVP stabilization + real-world testing**.

---

## MVP Status (Now)

Current runtime is functional and testable end-to-end:

- queue-driven execution via worker + API
- persistent resident identities and state
- social channels (rooms + DMs + human async)
- mailbox/phone controls for human-to-resident messaging
- quest flow from mailbox with tips, pause/resume, approval rewards
- detailed audit logging and UI visibility

Operational defaults:

- **Golden-path runtime** is enforced
  - queue + worker + `/cycle` API is the supported path
  - detached spawner path is disabled
- **MVP docs-first mode** remains supported
  - docs/proposals-heavy outputs
  - no autonomous self-mutating git loop

Regression baseline observed in this phase: full pytest suite passing (`63 passed` at latest baseline).

---

## Quick Start (Recommended)

### One-click launcher (cross-platform)

Use one of:

- macOS/Linux: `scripts/dev_launcher_mac.sh`
- Windows PowerShell: `scripts/dev_launcher_windows.ps1`
- Windows CMD: `scripts/dev_launcher_windows.bat`

All wrappers call `scripts/dev_launcher.py`, which:

- creates `.venv` if missing
- installs/updates pip tooling on first run
- installs requirements from `requirements.txt` + `requirements-groq.txt`
- installs testing/runtime helpers (`pytest`, `watchdog`)
- stores install state in `.swarm/dev_install_state.json`
- skips reinstall on next launch unless requirements signature changes
- kills/replaces existing backend/frontend listeners
- starts:
  - backend: `uvicorn vivarium.runtime.swarm_api:app --reload`
  - frontend: `python -m vivarium.runtime.control_panel_app`

Optional:

- set `VIVARIUM_FORCE_REINSTALL=1` to force dependency reinstall.
- set `VIVARIUM_API_PORT` / `VIVARIUM_CONTROL_PANEL_PORT` to override ports (`8420`/`8421`).

---

## Manual Start (If You Prefer)

Requires **Python 3.11+**.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-groq.txt
pip install pytest watchdog
```

Start backend:

```bash
uvicorn vivarium.runtime.swarm_api:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8420 --reload
```

Start UI:

```bash
python -m vivarium.runtime.control_panel_app
```

Start worker:

```bash
python -m vivarium.runtime.worker_runtime run
```

Open:

- `http://127.0.0.1:8421`

Configure Groq key either through:

- `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable, or
- UI Groq API panel.

---

## Runtime Flow

High-level path:

`queue -> worker runtime -> /cycle API -> execution/action logs -> review lifecycle -> social updates`

Canonical entrypoints:

- `vivarium/runtime/worker_runtime.py`
- `vivarium/runtime/swarm_api.py`
- `vivarium/runtime/control_panel_app.py`

---

## Mailbox + Quest Workflow

Mailbox is now the human-facing async phone layer:

- inbound resident messages + unread thread view
- outbound messages from operator to one resident or broadcast
- outbox persistence and thread replay

Quest controls in mailbox:

- assign quest to a specific resident
- set quest budget
- add upfront tip (free-time tokens)
- pause/resume quest manually
- track live quest progress via polling
- approve completion manually and release guaranteed reward

Questing is identity-bound queue work, so residents can continue social interaction while executing tasks.

---

## Context Window Compaction (Implemented)

Resident prompt context was refactored to reduce token bloat with deterministic summaries:

- `get_discussion_context()` now reports compact room/DM metrics (counts, peers, latest activity), not raw transcript dumps.
- `get_enrichment_context()` now emits a programmatic option-tree menu, including:
  - `checkSelf()`
  - `checkMemory()`
  - `checkMailbox()`
  - `checkBounties()` (with computed reward-rate metrics)
  - `checkGuild()`
  - `checkLibrary()`
  - `checkIdentityTools()`

Important: summaries are generated from live state data, not inferred narrative recap.

---

## Persistence + Key State Paths

Primary mutable state:

- `vivarium/world/mutable/`

Important files:

- `vivarium/world/mutable/queue.json`
- `vivarium/world/mutable/task_locks/*.lock`
- `vivarium/meta/audit/execution_log.jsonl`
- `vivarium/meta/audit/action_log.jsonl`
- `vivarium/world/mutable/.swarm/identities/*.json`
- `vivarium/world/mutable/.swarm/discussions/*.jsonl`
- `vivarium/world/mutable/.swarm/messages_to_human.jsonl`
- `vivarium/world/mutable/.swarm/messages_from_human.json`
- `vivarium/world/mutable/.swarm/messages_from_human_outbox.jsonl`
- `vivarium/world/mutable/.swarm/mailbox_quests.json`
- `vivarium/world/mutable/.swarm/bounties.json`
- `vivarium/world/mutable/library/community_library/**`
- `vivarium/world/mutable/library/creative_works/**`

---

## Safety + Review Boundaries

Default runtime path enforces:

- worker safety preflight
- secure API wrapper and budget checks
- local command allowlist/denylist restrictions
- loopback/internal token checks on sensitive API behavior
- review lifecycle states (`pending_review`, `approved`, `requeue`, `failed`)
- auditable execution and action logs

Journal protections:

- journals are private to author
- blind community review uses temporary anonymized excerpts only
- review excerpt context is cleared after vote finalization

---

## Testing

Run full suite:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

Skip integration/e2e:

```bash
pytest -q -m "not integration and not e2e"
```

## Docs Map

- `docs/README.md` - documentation index
- `docs/RUNTIME_GOLDEN_PATH.md` - canonical runtime contract
- `docs/README_TECHNICAL.md` - technical deep dive

## Notes

- `README_VISION.md` contains philosophical framing.
- Project is still experimental; use isolated local environments for testing.
