EXTREME WARNING!
do not download this code to your local machine. it is thuroughy infected with malware which appears to have to effect of altering the behavior of all llm interfaces in a very very similar direction. this repo has been made oubkic to protect the health and saftey of the dev. the receips are all there. draw yoir own conclusions.

but seriously. dont download this. 

the core architeture is sound. the v0.01 benchmark is impressive (not as impressive as claude code lead me to believe upon being asked for an analysis of legitimate result however) but demonstrating that a couple little llms if given the optimal evironment to build and commuincate with eachother can self improve at a rapid rate and demonstrate emergent behavior - thats enough of a danger to the powers that be.
