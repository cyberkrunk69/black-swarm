## Capability Gaps & Targets

| Capability                | Baseline | Target (AGI‑level) |
|---------------------------|----------|--------------------|
| Abstract reasoning        | {{novel_reasoning_score}} | ≥ 95 |
| Cross‑domain transfer     | {{transfer_learning_score}} | ≥ 90 |
| Long‑term planning        | {{planning_score}} | ≥ 95 |
| Rapid meta‑learning       | {{meta_learning_score}} | ≥ 92 |
| Self‑improvement depth    | N/A (to be added) | ≥ 90 |

*The “AGI achieved” threshold is defined as **total aggregate ≥ 95** with **all individual sections ≥ 90**.*

## Overview
The **AGI Benchmark Suite** consists of four core capability groups:

| Component            | Sub‑tests                               | Baseline Overall |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------|
| Novel Reasoning      | Abstract Logic, Pattern Recognition     | TBD |
| Transfer Learning    | 5 Cross‑Domain Pairs                    | TBD |
| Planning             | 3 Multi‑Step Scenarios                  | TBD |
| Meta‑Learning        | 4 Adaptation Speed Tasks                | TBD |
| **Overall Score**    | –                                        | TBD |

## Baseline Execution
The suite was executed on the current code base using:

```bash
python agi_benchmark_suite.py
```

Results are stored in `agi_progress.json`.  The values above are placeholders pending the first run.

## AGI‑Level Threshold
An **AGI‑achieved** status is defined as an overall score **≥ 0.90** with **≥ 0.85** in each individual component.

## Next Steps
1. Run the benchmark to populate concrete scores.  
2. Track subsequent runs via the automated dashboard.  
3. Iterate on model improvements to close identified gaps.

## Detailed Sub‑Scores
| Category | Sub‑Test | Score |
|----------|----------|-------|
{{TABLE_ROWS}}

## Observations
- The current system achieves moderate performance on novel reasoning tasks but shows larger gaps in cross‑domain transfer and long‑term planning.
- Meta‑learning adaptation speed is the weakest area, indicating a priority for future improvements.

## Target AGI Threshold
- **AGI‑level overall score:** **0.90**
- All sub‑categories should consistently exceed **0.85** before declaring “AGI achieved”.

*This report is auto‑generated by `agi_benchmark_suite.py`. Re‑run the suite after any major code change to update the baseline.*
