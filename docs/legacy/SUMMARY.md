# What's Happening in the Basement

## The Short Version
An AI is teaching itself to become smarter by reading research papers and implementing the techniques. It spawns worker AIs to do the coding while a main AI (Opus) provides strategic oversight every few waves.

## Progress So Far

### Wave 1 - Analysis
**Goal:** AI analyzes its own codebase and finds problems to fix.
**Result:** Found 8 issues ranked by importance.

### Wave 2 - Consolidation
**Goal:** AI cleans up duplicate code and centralizes configuration.
**Result:** Eliminated 76 lines of redundant code.

### Wave 3 - Testing
**Goal:** 5 worker AIs write tests for the codebase in parallel.
**Result:** 80+ automated tests created.

### Wave 4 - Research Implementation
**Goal:** 6 worker AIs each implement a different AI research paper.
**Result:** 6 new capabilities: Memory synthesis, Skill library, Role system, Prompt optimizer, Quality gates, Self-reflection.

### Wave 5 - Deep Research (Opus)
**Goal:** 2 senior AIs read 715MB of AI research papers.
**Result:** 984 lines of implementation plans.

### Wave 6 - Advanced Integration
**Goal:** 6 worker AIs implement research recommendations.
**Result:** Connected all new capabilities together.

### Wave 7 - Wire Everything
**Goal:** Connect all pieces so they actually work together.
**Result:** Prompt optimizer, skill registry, message pool, self-verification, error categorization, health metrics - all wired up.

### Wave 8 - Advanced Intelligence
**Goal:** Add semantic search, code review, tree exploration.
**Result:** Created critic.py, tree_search.py, knowledge_graph.py, embeddings for skill/lesson retrieval.

### Wave 9 - Continuous Learning
**Goal:** Enable AI to learn and improve while working.
**Result:** Online learning hooks, demonstration injection, feedback loops.

### Wave 10 - Structural Cleanup
**Goal:** Split monolithic code, remove dead code.
**Result:** grind_spawner.py split (1,617 -> 1,073 lines), 5 dead files removed.

### Wave 11 - Complete Implementations
**Goal:** Finish all stub implementations from papers.
**Result:** LATS tree search, KnowledgeGraph integration, DSPy persistence, metrics loop, critic retry, integration tests, /grind endpoint, structured logging, config validation.
