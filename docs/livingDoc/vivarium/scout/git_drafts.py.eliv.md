# _stem_for_file ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of toys, and inside the box, there's a smaller box with a toy inside. The big box is like the "repo root" and the smaller box is like the "file path".

This special helper function finds the name of the toy inside the smaller box, but it only looks at the name, not the whole box. If the smaller box is inside the big box, it finds the name of the toy. If it's not inside the big box, it just finds the name of the toy in the smaller box.

# assemble_pr_description ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of toys, and you want to write a note to tell your friends about the new toys you added. This special helper function is like a tool that writes that note for you.

It looks at all the new toys you added (like a list of files you changed), and for each toy, it tries to find a special note that you wrote about it. If it can't find the note, it says "No note available".

Then, it puts all the notes together in a big list, with each note labeled with the name of the toy. Finally, it gives you the whole list of notes as a big message that you can share with your friends.

# assemble_commit_message ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of toys, and you want to tell your friends what you did with each toy. You write a little note for each toy, and then you put all the notes together in one big paper.

This function is like a helper that writes those notes for you. It looks at all the toys (or files) you've changed, and for each one, it tries to find a note (or a special message) that you wrote earlier. If it can't find the note, it writes a default message that says "No note available".

Then, it puts all the notes together in one big paper, and that's the final message that says what you did with all the toys.
