# NavResponse ELIV

Imagine you have a special helper robot that can give you directions to find something. This helper robot gets answers from a super smart computer that can understand lots of things.

The "NavResponse" is like a special piece of paper that the helper robot uses to write down the directions it got from the super smart computer. It has some important information on it, like:

- What the directions say (like "go left, then right")
- How much money it cost to get those directions
- Which super smart computer gave us the directions
- How many words were in the directions we got
- How many words we asked the super smart computer to understand

The helper robot uses this special piece of paper to help us find what we're looking for!

# _get_groq_api_key ELIV

Imagine you want to play with a super cool toy, but it's locked in a box. The box has a special key that opens it. 

This function is like a helper that finds the key to the box. It looks in two places: 

1. Your computer's special settings (like a list of secrets).
2. A special place where the toy's owner keeps the key (called the "runtime config").

If it finds the key in either place, it gives it back to you. If it can't find the key, it says "I couldn't find the key, sorry!"

# call_groq_async ELIV

Imagine you have a special friend who can help you find your way around a big place. This friend is like a super smart guide who can answer your questions and show you where to go.

The "call_groq_async" function is like a special button that helps you talk to this guide friend. When you press the button, it sends a message to the guide saying "Hey, I need help finding my way!" and the guide sends back an answer.

The guide friend needs a special key to open the door to the answer, and this function helps find that key. If the key is not found, it says "Oh no, we can't find the key!" and stops.

When the guide sends back an answer, the function takes the answer and makes sense of it, like a translator. It then sends back the answer to you, along with some extra information like how much it cost to get the answer.

So, the "call_groq_async" function is like a helper that lets you talk to your super smart guide friend and gets the answers you need!
