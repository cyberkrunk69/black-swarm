# __all__ ELIV

Imagine you have a big box full of toys, and you want to tell your friends which toys are special and can be played with. The `__all__` thing is like a list of special toy names that you want to share with your friends.

When someone looks inside the box, they can only see the toys that are on this special list. It's like a key that opens the door to show them the special toys, but keeps the other toys hidden.
