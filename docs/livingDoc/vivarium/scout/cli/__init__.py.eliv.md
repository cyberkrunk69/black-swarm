# __all__ ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of toys, and inside the box, there are lots of different toys like blocks, dolls, and cars. But when you want to play with the toys, you don't want to see all the toys at once, just the ones you want to play with.

The `__all__` thing is like a special list that says which toys are allowed to come out of the box. In this case, it says "only the `main` toy is allowed to come out". It's like a key that opens the door to the `main` toy, but keeps all the other toys hidden inside the box.
