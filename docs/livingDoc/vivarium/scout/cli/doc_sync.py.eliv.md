# _handle_generate ELIV

Imagine you have a special tool that helps you make documents for a big project. This tool has a special button called "generate". When you press that button, the tool does some things to make sure everything is ready.

First, it looks for a special place where the documents should go. If that place doesn't exist, it says "oops, that place doesn't exist!" and stops.

If the place exists, it checks if you want to just look at what it would do (like a dry run) or if you want it to actually make the documents. If you want to just look, it shows you what it would do and stops.

If you want it to make the documents, it does some work to make sure everything is correct. If something goes wrong, it says "oops, something went wrong!" and stops.

If everything goes well, it makes the documents and says "yay, it's done!"

# _print_dry_run ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of toys, and you want to know what would happen if you cleaned up the toys without actually touching them. This function is like a special tool that helps you see what would happen.

It looks at a special place (called a "target") and says:

- If it's a toy (a file), it tells you what kind of toy it is and where it would go if you cleaned up.
- If it's a box of toys (a directory), it counts how many toys are inside and tells you where they would go if you cleaned up.

It's like a preview of what would happen if you cleaned up, but it doesn't actually touch anything.

# _handle_update ELIV

Imagine you have a special box with lots of tools inside. This box is like a computer program. 

The "_handle_update" function is like a key that helps open a special door in the box. When you use this key, it does a few things:

- It says "I'm working on it, but it's not ready yet" (like a sign on the door).
- Then it goes back to where it started, like closing the door.

It's like a helper that says "I know you want to do something, but it's not ready yet. Let's try again later."

# _handle_status ELIV

Imagine you have a special box with lots of buttons on it. Each button does a different thing. This function is like a key that opens a special button on the box.

When you use this key, it says "I'm not ready yet" and then it goes back to sleep. It's like saying "I'll do it later, but not now."

# main ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of toys, and inside the box, there are lots of different games and activities. But you need to know which game to play first. That's where the "main" function comes in. It's like a special key that opens the box and helps you decide which game to play.

When you use the key (or the "main" function), it looks at what you want to do (like play a game) and then it finds the right game for you. If you want to play a game, it will start the game. If you want to check the status of the games, it will show you the status.

The "main" function also helps you understand what you need to do to play the game. It's like a map that shows you the way to the game. And if you need help, it will show you the instructions on how to play the game.

So, the "main" function is like a helper that makes sure you have the right game and the right instructions to play it.
