# _parse_nav_json ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of toys, and inside the box, there's a special note that says "open me to see the toys". But sometimes, the note is wrapped in a special paper that says "open me carefully".

This function is like a key that opens the box and reads the note. It takes the note as a string (like a long sentence) and tries to understand what it says. If the note is wrapped in the special paper, it removes the paper first.

Then, it tries to turn the note into a special list of things (like a list of toys). If it can't do that, it says "I couldn't understand the note" and gives a special answer instead.

# _quick_parse ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of toys, and you want to look at the first few toys to see what's inside. This function is like a helper that opens the box and shows you the first few toys.

It takes two things: the box (called `file_path`) and how many toys to show (called `max_chars`). If the box doesn't exist, it says "oh, the box is empty!" and shows nothing.

If the box is okay, it opens the box and reads the first few toys (up to `max_chars`). If there's a problem opening the box, it says "oops, can't open the box!" and shows nothing.

The helper then shows you the first few toys, like a little peek inside the box.

# parse_args ELIV

Imagine you have a special box with lots of buttons and levers. This box is like a computer program. When you want to use the program, you need to tell it what to do. You can do this by pressing the right buttons and turning the levers.

The "parse_args" function is like a helper that looks at the buttons and levers you pressed. It figures out what you want to do and makes a special list of what you asked for.

For example, if you pressed the "task" button and typed in "fix a bug", the helper would make a list that says "fix a bug". Then, the program can use that list to do what you asked for.

The helper looks at the buttons and levers you pressed, and it makes a list of what you asked for. That's what the "parse_args" function does!

# query_file ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of toys, and you want to find a specific toy inside. You can ask a friend to help you find it. 

This special helper function, called `query_file`, is like asking your friend for help. It looks at a file (like a box of toys), and you ask it a question about the file (like "where is the red ball?"). 

It then talks to a super smart computer (like a magic genie) that tries to find the answer for you. The computer gives you a hint, like "the red ball is on the top shelf, in the box labeled 'cars'". 

The helper function then checks if the hint is correct, and if it is, it gives you the answer. If not, it tries again. It keeps trying until it finds the answer or gives up. 

The answer is like a map that shows you exactly where the toy is, so you can go find it easily.

# print_pretty ELIV

Imagine you have a special report from a scout who went on a mission. This report has lots of information about what the scout did, like what task they were doing, which tool they used, and how long it took.

The "print_pretty" function is like a special printer that takes this report and makes it look nice and easy to read. It prints out things like:

- What task the scout was doing
- Which tool they used
- How long it took
- What the scout found
- Any suggestions they have

It's like a key that opens a door to a special report, and it makes it look pretty and fun to read!

# generate_brief ELIV

Imagine you have a special tool that helps you write a report about something. This tool is like a robot that takes some information and turns it into a nice, easy-to-read report.

It takes two things: some information (like a puzzle piece) and a task (like a question). Then, it uses that information to write a report with some important details, like what the task is, what the robot found, and why it thinks that.

The robot writes the report in a special way, like a list with headings and spaces. When it's all done, it gives you the report, and you can read it easily.

# _main_async ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of toys, and you want to find a specific toy. This special function is like a helper that finds the toy for you.

It looks at what you want to do, and then it does it. If you want to find a toy by its name, it tries to find it first in a special book that has lots of toys listed. If it can't find it there, it asks a friend who knows a lot of things (like a super smart librarian) to help find it.

If you want to find a toy in a specific box, it looks in that box. If you want to find a toy by its name, but you don't know which box it's in, it uses a special map to help find it.

If it can't find the toy, it tells you that it couldn't find it. But if it does find the toy, it shows you where it is and what it looks like!

# main ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of toys, and inside the box, there are lots of fun things to play with. But, you need a special key to open the box.

The "main" function is like that special key. It helps open the box, and when it does, it lets other things inside the box do their jobs.

When you use the "main" key, it talks to some other helpers inside the box, like a map reader, a rule checker, and a super smart friend. They all work together to make sure everything runs smoothly.

The "main" key then says, "Okay, everything is done!" and that's when the box closes. The "main" key helps make sure everything gets done correctly, and that's its job!
