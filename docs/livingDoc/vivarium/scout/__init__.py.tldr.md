# __all__

The `__all__` constant is a list of strings that specifies the names of the objects to be imported when using the `from module import *` syntax. Its primary purpose is to control which symbols are exposed when importing a module. It is typically used in modules with multiple functions or classes to prevent all of them from being imported by default.
