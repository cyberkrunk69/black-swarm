[pytest]
+markers =
+    integration: marks tests as integration tests (deselect with '-m "not integration"')
```

Now `pytest` will discover both naming conventions, and developers can run `pytest -m "not integration"` for fast unit‑only runs.

### 5.4 Enforce Branch‑Protection Rules in the Remote Repository  

This step is performed via the GitHub UI or API; no code change is required. The required actions are:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules**.  
2. Edit the rule for `main` and enable:  
   * **Require status checks to pass before merging** – select `ci.yml` (both jobs).  
   * **Require linear history** – already enabled.  
   * **Require pull request reviews before merging** – already enabled.  

Document the new policy in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### 5.5 Document the New Process in `CONTRIBUTING.md`

Add a **Testing** section that explains how to run the full suite locally and how the CI works.

**Patch:** `CONTRIBUTING.md`

```diff
FILE: CONTRIBUTING.md
<<<<<<< SEARCH
## Pull Request Process
...
=======
## Pull Request Process
...

## Testing

Before opening a pull request, ensure that **all** tests pass locally.

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pytest

# Run pytest (covers both pytest and unittest suites)
pytest
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

The repository now includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that automatically runs the same commands on every push and pull request. Merges to `main` are blocked until this workflow reports success.

If you prefer to run only unit tests during rapid development, you can use the `integration` marker:

```bash
pytest -m "not integration"
```

The pre‑push hook located in `git-hooks/pre-push` will also prevent accidental pushes when tests fail. Install it by running:

```bash
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

```
