Request cancellation logic (io_poll_cancel)\n2. Async completion of linked requests\n3. Potential race conditions where io_kiocb could be freed while accessed\n4. Use-after-free (UAF) vulnerabilities in concurrent code paths\n\nTrace specific line numbers. Do NOT hallucinate.\n\nIf already hardened, explain the protection mechanisms.\n\nCREATE kernel_analysis.md with findings.",
