Code Review – grind_spawner_unified.py (changes around lines 640 and 717)

### Change @ line ~640 – Adding `traceback.print_exc()` in the exception handler
**What was added**
```python
except Exception as e:
    traceback.print_exc()
    # existing handling code …
```

**Assessment**
- **Pros:** Printing the full traceback greatly aids debugging when an unexpected exception occurs during task spawning. It does not alter program logic or performance in a production run (the traceback is only printed when an exception is raised).
- **Cons:** None significant. The only minor downside is a potentially noisy log if the exception is expected and already handled elsewhere, but the surrounding code already logs the error, so the extra detail is valuable.

**Verdict:** **Keep** this change. It improves observability without side‑effects.

### Change @ line ~717 – Adding `if args.once: print …; break` after a wave completes
**What was added**
```python
# after a wave of tasks has been processed
if args.once:
    print("`--once` flag detected – stopping after first wave.")
    break
```

**Assessment**
- The intention is to honor the `--once` flag by stopping the spawner after the first wave of tasks.
- However, the bug described (“225 tasks loaded even with `--once` specified”) indicates that tasks for *subsequent* waves are still being queued **before** this break is reached. The break only exits the *inner* processing loop after the wave has already been generated, so the extra tasks have already been created.
- Placing the break here does not prevent the spawner from **loading** tasks for the next wave; it only stops further processing *after* they have been loaded.

**Recommended Action**
- **Revert** the current insertion (or move the `if args.once` check *upstream* before any task‑generation logic for the next wave).
- A better implementation is to check `args.once` **immediately after the wave‑initialisation decision** and exit the outer loop *before* any new tasks are spawned.

**Suggested replacement (conceptual)**
```python
while not done:
    # decide whether to start a new wave
    if args.once and wave_index > 0:
        print("`--once` flag detected – no further waves will be started.")
        break
    # ... existing wave creation logic ...
```

**Verdict:** **Revert** the current `if args.once: … break` placed after wave completion and implement the check earlier as illustrated above.

---

### Summary
- **Keep** the `traceback.print_exc()` addition (line ~640).  
- **Revert** or relocate the `if args.once` guard (line ~717) because it does not correctly prevent extra tasks from being loaded; the check should occur before any new wave is instantiated.

--- End of Review ---
[Analysis] The `--once` flag handling appears at line ~717 in `grind_spawner_unified.py`. Although it looks like it is placed after the code that discovers and loads task files, the actual loading of tasks is performed by a function (e.g., `load_tasks`) that is only invoked *after* the `if args.once:` block. The `if args.once:` condition prints the message and calls `sys.exit(0)` before the loading function is called. Therefore, when `--once` is supplied the program terminates early, skipping the call that would read the `grind_tasks_*.json` files, which is why no 225+ tasks are loaded. The earlier claim that the check was “in the wrong place” was based on a surface reading of the file ordering, but the control‑flow shows the early exit prevents the loading step from ever executing.
