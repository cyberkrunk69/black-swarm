# Scout

Scout is a Git-native, text-first context and drafting layer for AI-assisted
development workflows.

This file is the quick entry point. The complete docs set is:

- Vision (what Scout is aiming to be):
  - `../../docs/scout/README_VISION.md`
- Technical (what Scout is currently and how it works):
  - `../../docs/scout/README_TECHNICAL.md`
- Current-state white paper:
  - `../../.github/PR_WHITEPAPER.md`

Supporting references:

- Configuration:
  - `../../docs/scout/CONFIGURATION.md`
- Audit event schema:
  - `../../docs/scout/AUDIT_SCHEMA.md`

At a glance, Scout currently focuses on:

- living docs generated from source (`.tldr.md`, `.deep.md`, `.eliv.md`),
- draft generation and assembly for commit/PR workflows,
- scoped navigation/indexing/briefing tooling,
- explicit cost and event auditability.
