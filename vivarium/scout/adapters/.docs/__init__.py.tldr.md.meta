      "deep": "## Logic Overview\nThe code defines a Python constant `__all__` which is a list containing two string values: \"LanguageAdapter\" and \"SymbolTree\". This constant is used to specify the modules or variables that should be imported when using the `from module import *` syntax.\n\n## Dependency Interactions\nThe code does not make any direct calls to other functions or methods. However, it imports the `vivarium/scout/adapters/base.py` module, which suggests that the `LanguageAdapter` and `SymbolTree` variables are likely defined in this module.\n\n## Potential Considerations\nThere are no explicit error handling mechanisms or edge cases in this code snippet. The performance impact of this code is minimal, as it only defines a constant. However, the use of `__all__` can affect how the module is imported and used by other parts of the program.\n\n## Signature\nN/A",
