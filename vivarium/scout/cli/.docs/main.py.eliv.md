# _cmd_config ELIV

Imagine you have a special box where you keep all your favorite things, like toys and stickers. This box has a special key that helps you open it and get what you need.

The `_cmd_config` function is like a key that helps you open the box and do different things with it. It's like a special button that says "what do you want to do with the box?"

When you press the button, it asks you what you want to do. Do you want to:

- Get something from the box? It will show you what's inside.
- Put something new in the box? It will help you add it.
- Fix the box if it's not working right? It will try to make it better.
- Look at all the things in the box? It will show you a list.
- Open the box and play with it? It will open the box and let you play.

If you want to do something, it will try to help you. If it can't, it will tell you what went wrong.

# _cmd_on_commit ELIV

Imagine you have a special box where you keep all your toys. When you make a new toy, you want to tell your friends about it, right? 

This function is like a messenger who helps tell your friends about the new toy. It looks at the toys you've made (called "files") and figures out which ones are new. Then, it sends a message to your friends (called "router") saying "Hey, I made a new toy!" 

The function also checks if you're telling it about the toys in a special way, and if so, it reads the list of toys from a special pipe. It's like a key that opens a door to get the list of toys. 

Finally, it says "I'm done!" and goes back to sleep, waiting for the next time you make a new toy.

# _cmd_prepare_commit_msg ELIV

Imagine you're working on a big project with your friends. You all write down what you did in a special notebook called a "commit message". 

This function is like a helper that makes sure the notebook is filled in correctly. It looks for a special draft (like a rough version of the notebook) and uses it to fill in the notebook. 

If it can't find the draft, it just says "okay" and moves on. If it finds the draft, it uses it to fill in the notebook and says "done!"

# main ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of toys, and inside the box, there are lots of different games and activities. The "main" function is like a special key that opens the box and lets you choose which game to play.

When you use the key (or run the "main" function), it asks you what game you want to play. You can choose from a few different options, like "config" (which is like setting up the game), "on-commit" (which is like saving your progress), or "prepare-commit-msg" (which is like writing a message about your game).

The "main" function then does what you asked it to do, and it might even ask you for some more information, like what files you want to use or what message you want to write. When it's all done, it tells you if everything worked out okay or not.
