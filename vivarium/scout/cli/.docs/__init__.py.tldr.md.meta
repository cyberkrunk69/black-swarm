      "tldr": "The `__all__` constant is used to specify the list of symbols to be imported when using the `from module import *` syntax. It is not called or used in the system, but it is imported from `vivarium/scout/cli/main.py`.",
      "deep": "## Logic Overview\nThe code defines a Python constant `__all__` and assigns it a list containing a single string value, `\"main\"`. This constant is typically used to specify the modules, functions, or variables that should be imported when using the `from module import *` syntax. The flow of the code is straightforward, with no conditional statements or loops. The main step is the assignment of the list `[\"main\"]` to the `__all__` constant.\n\n## Dependency Interactions\nThe code does not make any direct calls to other functions or methods. However, it imports the `vivarium/scout/cli/main.py` module. The `__all__` constant does not directly interact with this import, but it may influence how the imported module is used. The qualified name `main` in the `__all__` list may refer to a module, function, or variable defined in the imported `main.py` file.\n\n## Potential Considerations\nThere are no explicit error handling mechanisms or performance optimizations in the code. The assignment of the `__all__` constant is a simple operation that does not involve any edge cases or potential errors. However, the implications of this assignment may depend on how the module is used elsewhere in the codebase. For example, if the `main` module or function is not defined in the imported `main.py` file, it may lead to a `NameError` when trying to import it using the `from module import *` syntax.\n\n## Signature\nN/A",
