If this fails, it defaults to the absolute path.\n3. **Constructing a prompt**: A prompt is constructed using the relative file path, the file context, and the question being asked. This prompt is designed to elicit a response from a language model.\n4. **Calling the language model**: The prompt is then passed to the `call_groq_async` function, which calls a language model (specifically, the \"llama-3.1-8b-instant\" model) to get a response.\n5. **Parsing the response**: The response from the language model is parsed using the `_parse_nav_json` function, which extracts relevant information such as the file, line number, function name, and explanation.\n6. **Validating the suggestion**: The parsed suggestion is then validated using the `validate_location` function to ensure that it is valid.\n7. **Returning the result**: Finally, the function returns a dictionary containing the relative file path, the answer from the language model, the validity of the suggestion, the cost of the query, and other relevant information.\n\n## Dependency Interactions\nThe `query_file` function interacts with the following dependencies:\n* `_parse_nav_json`: This function is used to parse the response from the language model.\n* `_quick_parse`: This function is used to parse the file context.\n* `call_groq_async`: This function is used to call the language model and get a response.\n* `file_path.relative_to`: This method is used to get the relative path of the file with respect to the repository root.\n* `parsed.get`: This method is used to extract relevant information from the parsed response.\n* `str`: This function is used to convert the file path to a string.\n* `suggestion.get`: This method is used to extract relevant information from the suggestion dictionary.\n* `vivarium.scout.validator.validate_location`: This function is used to validate the suggestion.\n\n## Potential Considerations\nSome potential considerations when using this function include:\n* **Error handling**: The function catches `ValueError` exceptions when trying to get the relative path of the file.
