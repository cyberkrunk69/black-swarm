# _last_doc_sync_time ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of toys, and inside the box, there are lots of little notes that tell you what each toy is. This special helper looks at all the notes and finds the one that was written most recently. 

It checks every toy to see if it has a note, and if it does, it looks at the date on the note to see when it was written. If it finds a note that was written more recently than the one it found before, it keeps that one. 

Then, it makes a list of all the toys and the most recent note it found for each one. That's what this helper does!

# _missing_drafts ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of toys, and inside the box, there are some toys that you've already played with and written a note about what you did with them. This function is like a helper that looks for toys in the box that don't have a note yet.

It checks each toy to see if there's a note about it. If there isn't a note, it adds the toy to a special list. Then, it gives you the list of toys that don't have a note.

# _git_hook_status ELIV

Imagine you have a special box where you keep all your toys. Inside the box, there are two special keys: one for when you want to put a toy away, and one for when you want to say "yay, I did it!"

This function is like a helper that checks if you have those two special keys. It looks in the box (called a "repo") to see if the keys are there. If they are, it says "yes, you have them!" If not, it says "no, you don't have them yet!"

It's like checking if you have a key to open a door. If you have the key, you can open the door. If not, you can't. This function helps you know if you have the keys to open the doors to putting toys away and saying "yay, I did it!"

# run_status ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of toys, and inside the box, there are lots of different things like blocks, dolls, and cars. This special function, called "run_status", is like a helper that looks at the box and tells you what's inside.

It checks three things:

1. What toys are ready to be played with (like blocks and dolls that are all set up and ready to go).
2. If there are any toys that are missing (like a doll that's not in the box).
3. If the toys are working properly (like if the blocks are building a castle correctly).

Then, it writes down what it finds in a special report, like a list of what's inside the box. This report is like a key that helps you understand what's going on with your toys.

# main ELIV

Imagine you have a special box with lots of tools inside. The "main" function is like a key that opens the box.

When you use the key (or the "main" function), it does three things:

1. It finds the special place where all the tools are kept (like a big folder).
2. It runs a test to see what's inside the folder (like checking what toys are in the box).
3. It shows you the results (like telling you what toys are inside the box).

Then, it says "okay, everything is done!" and closes the box.
