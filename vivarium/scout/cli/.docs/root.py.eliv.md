# _cmd_commit ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of toys, and you want to tell your friends what new toys you got. This function helps you write a message to tell them.

It looks at the toys you've already put in the box (like a special list), and finds the toys that are special (like toys made of blocks). Then, it reads a special note that you wrote about each toy, and puts all the notes together to make one big message.

If you want to just see the message, it shows it to you. If you want to really tell your friends, it writes the message on a special paper and uses a special tool to tell everyone about the new toys.

# _cmd_pr ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of toys, and you want to tell your friends about all the cool things you found in the box. This special tool, called `_cmd_pr`, helps you do that.

It looks at the box and finds all the toys that are new and special (like a key that opens a door). Then, it reads a special note for each toy (like a label on a toy box). It puts all the notes together to make a big story about the toys.

If you want to see the story on your computer screen, it will show it to you. If you want to see it on a special browser, it will do that too. But if there are no new toys in the box, it will say "oh no, there's nothing new!" and stop.

# main ELIV

Imagine you have a special box with lots of buttons and levers. This box is like a computer program. The "main" function is like a special key that opens the box.

When you use the key, it makes the box do different things depending on which button you press. If you press the "commit" button, it does one thing. If you press the "PR" button, it does another thing. If you press the "status" button, it shows you a special dashboard.

The key also checks if you want to use a special draft or not. It's like choosing between two different recipes for a cake. If you want to use the draft, it will use it. If you don't want to use the draft, it will do something else.

The key also has a special preview button. It's like looking at a picture of the cake before you bake it. You can see what it will look like without actually making it.

When you press the buttons, the box does its thing and then it's done. The key is like a magic wand that makes the box work!
