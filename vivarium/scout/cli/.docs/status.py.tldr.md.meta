If either of these documentation files exists, it retrieves the last modification time (`mtime`) of the most recently modified file. The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a Python file and its corresponding latest documentation file's modification time (or `None` if no documentation file exists).\n\n## Dependency Interactions\nThe function interacts with the following dependencies through the traced calls:\n- `doc_path.exists()`: Checks if a documentation file exists.\n- `doc_path.stat()`: Retrieves the file statistics, including the last modification time (`st_mtime`), of a documentation file.\n- `result.append()`: Adds a tuple containing a Python file and its latest documentation file's modification time to the result list.\n\n## Potential Considerations\n- The function handles the case where a documentation file exists but its `stat()` call raises an `OSError` by catching the exception and ignoring the file.\n- If multiple documentation files exist for a Python file, the function will return the modification time of the most recently modified file.\n- The function does not use the `repo_root` parameter in its logic, which might be an oversight or an indication that this parameter is used elsewhere in the codebase.\n- The function's performance could be affected by the number of Python files and documentation files it needs to process, as it performs a separate `exists()` and `stat()` call for each documentation file.\n\n## Signature\nThe function signature is `def _last_doc_sync_time(repo_root: Path, py_files: List[Path]) -> List[tuple[Path, Optional[float]]]`, indicating that:\n- It takes two parameters: `repo_root` of type `Path` and `py_files` of type `List[Path]`.\n- It returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a `Path` (the Python file) and an `Optional[float]` (the latest documentation file's modification time or `None` if no documentation file exists).",

      "deep": "## Logic Overview\nThe `_missing_drafts` function takes two parameters: `repo_root` and `staged_py`. It iterates over each file in `staged_py`, constructs a draft path, and checks if the draft path exists. If the draft path does not exist, the file is added to the `missing` list. The function returns the `missing` list.\n\nHere are the main steps:\n1. Initialize an empty list `missing` to store files without corresponding draft paths.\n2. Iterate over each file `f` in `staged_py`.\n3. For each file, construct the draft path by combining `draft_dir` with the file stem and the suffix `.commit.txt`.\n4. Check if the draft path exists using the `exists` method.\n5. If the draft path does not exist, add the file to the `missing` list.\n6. Return the `missing` list.\n\n## Dependency Interactions\nThe function interacts with the following dependencies:\n- `draft_path.exists`: This call checks if the draft path exists. The `exists` method is called on the `draft_path` object, which is of type `Path`.\n- `missing.append`: This call adds a file to the `missing` list when its corresponding draft path does not exist.\n\nThe function uses the following types:\n- `Path`: The type of `repo_root`, `draft_dir`, `f`, and `draft_path`.\n- `List[Path]`: The type of `staged_py` and `missing`.\n\nThe function imports the following modules:\n- `vivarium/scout/audit.py`\n- `vivarium/scout/git_analyzer.py`\n- `vivarium/scout/ignore.py`\n\nHowever, these imports are not used within the function.\n\n## Potential Considerations\nBased on the code, the following potential considerations can be identified:\n- **Error Handling**: The function does not handle any potential errors that may occur when checking if the draft path exists or when appending to the `missing` list.\n- **Edge Cases**: The function assumes that `repo_root` and `staged_py` are valid inputs. It does not handle cases where `repo_root` is not a valid directory or `staged_py` is an empty list.\n- **Performance**: The function iterates over each file in `staged_py` and checks if the draft path exists. This could potentially be slow if `staged_py` contains a large number of files.\n\n## Signature\nThe function signature is:\n```python\ndef _missing_drafts(repo_root: Path, staged_py: List[Path]) -> List[Path]\n```\nThis indicates that the function:\n- Takes two parameters: `repo_root` of type `Path` and `staged_py` of type `List[Path]`.\n- Returns a list of `Path` objects.\nThe function name starts with an underscore, suggesting that it is intended to be a private function.",

It constructs the path to the Git hooks directory by joining the `repo_root` with `.git` and `hooks`.\n2. It checks the existence of two specific hook files: `prepare-commit-msg` and `post-commit`.\n3. It returns a dictionary with the names of these hooks as keys and their existence status as boolean values.\n\n## Dependency Interactions\nThe function does not make any explicit calls to other functions or methods based on the provided traced calls. However, it uses the `Path` type, which is likely imported from the `pathlib` module, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the traced imports. The traced imports are:\n- `vivarium/scout/audit.py`\n- `vivarium/scout/git_analyzer.py`\n- `vivarium/scout/ignore.py`\nNone of these imports are directly referenced in the function.\n\n## Potential Considerations\n- **Error Handling**: The function does not handle potential errors that might occur when accessing the file system, such as permission errors or if the `repo_root` does not exist.\n- **Edge Cases**: The function assumes that the `repo_root` is a valid path to a Git repository. If this is not the case, the function may not behave as expected.\n- **Performance**: The function performs two separate existence checks. While this is straightforward and efficient for the given task, it does not account for potential performance issues if the function is called frequently or on very large repositories.\n\n## Signature\nThe function signature is `def _git_hook_status(repo_root: Path) -> dict[str, bool]`.

Initialization: It initializes an empty list `lines` to store the status output and resolves the `repo_root` path.\n2. Staged files: It retrieves a list of staged files using `vivarium.scout.git_analyzer.get_changed_files`, filters out non-Python files, and ignores files that match patterns defined in `vivarium.scout.ignore.IgnorePatterns`.\n3. Last doc-sync: It checks the last modification time of `.tldr.md` or `.deep.md` files for each staged Python file and appends the status to the `lines` list.\n4. Missing drafts: It checks for missing commit drafts in the `docs/drafts` directory and appends the status to the `lines` list.\n5. Audit: hourly spend: It retrieves the hourly spend from the `vivarium.scout.audit.AuditLog` and appends the status to the `lines` list.\n6. Accuracy: It retrieves accuracy metrics from the `vivarium.scout.audit.AuditLog` for the last 24 hours and appends the status to the `lines` list.\n7. Git hooks: It checks the status of Git hooks using `_git_hook_status` and appends the status to the `lines` list.\n8. Finalization: It closes the `vivarium.scout.audit.AuditLog` and returns the status output as a string by joining the `lines` list with newline characters.\n\n## Dependency Interactions\nThe `run_status` function interacts with the following dependencies:\n* `vivarium.scout.git_analyzer.get_changed_files`: Retrieves a list of staged files.\n* `vivarium.scout.ignore.IgnorePatterns`: Ignores files that match specific patterns.\n* `_last_doc_sync_time`: Retrieves the last modification time of `.tldr.md` or `.deep.md` files.\n* `_missing_drafts`: Checks for missing commit drafts in the `docs/drafts` directory.\n* `vivarium.scout.audit.AuditLog`: Retrieves hourly spend and accuracy metrics.\n* `_git_hook_status`: Checks the status of Git hooks.\n* `datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp`: Converts a timestamp to a datetime object.\n* `datetime.datetime.now`: Retrieves the current datetime.\n* `datetime.timedelta`: Represents a time interval.\n* `pathlib.Path`: Represents a file system path.\n* `pathlib.Path.relative_to`: Retrieves the relative path of a file.\n\n## Potential Considerations\nThe code handles the following edge cases and potential considerations:\n* It checks if there are any staged Python files before attempting to retrieve the last modification time of `.tldr.md` or `.deep.md` files.\n* It handles the case where a file is not found in the `docs/drafts` directory by appending a \"none\" message to the `lines` list.\n* It uses a try-except block to handle the case where a file is not relative to the `repo_root` path.\n* It closes the `vivarium.scout.audit.AuditLog` after use to ensure proper resource management.\n* The function does not appear to handle any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the dependencies, which could potentially lead to errors.\n\n## Signature\nThe `run_status` function has the following signature:\n```python\ndef run_status(repo_root: Path) -> str:\n```\nIt takes a single argument `repo_root` of type `Path` and returns a string. The `Path` type is likely from the `pathlib` module, which represents a file system path. The return type is a string, which is the status output generated by the function.",
