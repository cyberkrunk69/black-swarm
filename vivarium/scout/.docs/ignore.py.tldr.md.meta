The logic is straightforward: it simply assigns a list of ignore patterns to the `BUILT_IN_IGNORES` constant.\n\n## Dependency Interactions\nThere are no dependency interactions in this code. The traced facts indicate that there are no calls, no uses of types, and no imports. The code is self-contained and does not rely on any external dependencies.\n\n## Potential Considerations\nThe code does not include any error handling or performance optimizations. The list of ignore patterns is hardcoded and may need to be updated if new patterns are required. The use of glob patterns (e.g., `**/.git/**`) may have performance implications if the directory structure is very large. Additionally, the code does not account for potential edge cases, such as file system permissions or encoding issues.\n\n## Signature\nN/A",
