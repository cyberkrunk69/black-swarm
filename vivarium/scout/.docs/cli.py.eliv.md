- If you want to make sure the secrets are written correctly, it will check for you.
- If you want to see what secrets you have, it will show them to you.
- If you want to change the secrets, it will open a special editor for you to do that.

# _cmd_on_commit ELIV

Imagine you have a special box where you keep all your toys. When you make a new toy, you want to tell your friends about it, right? 

This function is like a messenger who helps tell your friends about the new toy. It looks at the toys you made (called "files") and figures out which ones are new. Then, it tells the "router" (like a special helper) to let your friends know about the new toys. 

The function also helps if you're telling your friends about the toys in a special way, like writing them on a piece of paper. It makes sure to read the paper correctly so it can tell your friends about the toys. 

Finally, it says "okay, I'm done!" and goes back to sleep.

# main ELIV

Imagine you have a big box full of toys, and inside the box, there are lots of different compartments. Each compartment has a special key that opens it.

The "main" function is like a special key that opens the box. When you use this key, it helps you figure out which compartment to open first.

It looks at what you want to do, like "open the compartment with the toys" or "open the compartment with the rules". Then, it uses the right key to open the right compartment.

If you want to open the compartment with the rules, it will ask you for some information, like what rule you want to change. If you want to open the compartment with the toys, it will ask you which toys you want to play with.

The "main" function is like a helper that makes sure you get to the right compartment and can do what you want to do.
