Checking the current time (`now = time.monotonic()`) to determine if a sync is needed based on a time interval (`FSYNC_INTERVAL_SEC`) or a line count threshold (`FSYNC_EVERY_N_LINES`).\n3. If a sync is needed, the method attempts to:\n   - Flush the file buffer (`self._file.flush()`)\n   - Sync the file to disk using `os.fsync(self._file.fileno())`\n4. After a successful sync, the method resets the line counter (`self._lines_since_fsync = 0`) and updates the last sync time (`self._last_fsync = now`).\n\n## Dependency Interactions\nThe method interacts with the following traced calls:\n- `time.monotonic()`: used to get the current time in seconds since the epoch.\n- `self._file.fileno()`: used to get the file descriptor of the file object, which is then passed to `os.fsync()`.\n- `self._file.flush()`: used to flush the file buffer before syncing.\n- `os.fsync()`: used to sync the file to disk.\n\n## Potential Considerations\n- The method catches `OSError` exceptions that may occur during the sync process, but it does not handle other potential exceptions that may be raised by the `time.monotonic()`, `self._file.fileno()`, `self._file.flush()`, or `os.fsync()` calls.\n- The method checks if the file is not `None` and not closed before attempting to sync it, which suggests that the file object may be closed or set to `None` at some point in the code.\n- The performance of this method may be affected by the frequency of syncs, as syncing too frequently can impact performance.\n- The method does not appear to handle the case where `FSYNC_EVERY_N_LINES` or `FSYNC_INTERVAL_SEC` is set to a very large or very small value, which could potentially cause issues.\n\n## Signature\nThe method signature is `def _fsync_if_needed(self) -> None`, indicating that:\n- The method is an instance method (due to the `self` parameter).\n- The method does not return any value (due to the `-> None` return type hint).\n- The method is intended to be private (due to the leading underscore in its name), suggesting that it should not be called directly from outside the class.",

However, it does skip lines that result in `None` when parsed, which implies that `self._parse_line(line)` handles or logs such errors internally.\n- **Performance**: The method is designed to be memory-efficient for large logs by streaming the JSONL parser.
