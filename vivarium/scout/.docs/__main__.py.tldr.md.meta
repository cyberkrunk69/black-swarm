      "deep": "## Logic Overview\nThe code defines the `__main__` module for the `vivarium.scout` package, allowing it to be executed directly using `python -m vivarium.scout`. The main steps are:\n1. Import the `main` function from `vivarium.scout.cli`.\n2. Check if the current module is the main module (`if __name__ == \"__main__\":`).\n3. If it is the main module, call the `main` function and exit the program with the returned status code using `raise SystemExit(main())`.\n\n## Dependency Interactions\nThe code imports the `main` function from `vivarium.scout.cli`. This is the only dependency interaction traced. The qualified name of the imported module is `vivarium.scout.cli.main`.\n\n## Potential Considerations\n- The code does not handle any potential exceptions that might be raised by the `main` function. If an exception occurs, it will be propagated and the program will terminate.\n- The performance of the code is directly dependent on the `main` function from `vivarium.scout.cli`, as it is the entry point of the program.\n- The code does not provide any error handling or logging mechanisms. Any errors that occur during execution will be handled by the `main` function or the Python interpreter.\n\n## Signature\nN/A",
