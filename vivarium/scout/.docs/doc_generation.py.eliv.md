# logger ELIV

Imagine you have a big notebook where you write down important messages. This notebook is special because it helps you keep track of what's happening in a big project.

The 'logger' is like a special pen that writes down these messages in the notebook. It talks to other parts of the project, like other notebooks, to get the messages it needs to write.

When something important happens, the 'logger' writes it down in the notebook, so you can see what's going on. It's like keeping a diary of the project's adventures!

# TLDR_MODEL ELIV

Imagine you have a special box that can talk to lots of other boxes. This box needs to know which special friend to talk to, so it can understand what you want.

The 'TLDR_MODEL' is like a special name tag that says which friend to talk to. It's like a key that opens a door to a specific box, so the other boxes know exactly who to talk to.

In this case, the name tag says "llama-3.1-8b-instant". This means the box will talk to a special friend named "llama-3.1-8b-instant".
---

# DEEP_MODEL ELIV

Imagine you have a special box that can talk to other boxes. This box is like a key that helps the other boxes know what kind of special talker to use. 

The special talker is like a super smart friend who can understand lots of things. The key, "DEEP_MODEL", says to use a specific super smart friend named "llama-3.1-8b-instant". This helps the other boxes work together better.
---

# ELIV_MODEL ELIV

Imagine you have a special box that can talk to other boxes. This box is like a key that helps the other boxes know what kind of special talker to use. 

The ELIV_MODEL is like that key. It tells the other boxes to use a special kind of talker called "llama-3.1-8b-instant". This helps them understand what to do when they talk to each other.

# _extract_logic_hints ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of LEGOs, and inside the box, there are instructions on how to build a castle. The instructions are like a secret code that only the person who built the castle can understand.

This special tool, called `_extract_logic_hints`, helps us figure out what kind of instructions are inside the box. It looks for special words like "loop", "return", and "call" that tell us what the instructions are doing.

It's like a key that opens a door to a secret room where the instructions are hidden. When it finds one of these special words, it adds it to a list so we can see what's inside the box.

The tool looks at every single instruction in the box and checks if it's one of these special words. If it is, it adds it to the list. Then, it gives us the list of special words so we can understand what the instructions are doing.
---

# _build_signature ELIV

Imagine you have a special box with a lock on it. The lock has a key that fits perfectly. This key is like a special code that tells us what's inside the box.

The `_build_signature` function is like a tool that helps us find the key for a special box called a "function". A function is like a recipe that tells a computer what to do.

This tool looks at the function and tries to find the key (the code) that tells us what's inside. If it can't find the key, it makes a new key based on the ingredients (the things the function uses) and the name of the function.

The key (the code) is like a special string that we can use to understand what the function does. It's like a map that shows us how to use the function.
---

# _parse_assign_targets ELIV

Imagine you have a bunch of toys in a box, and you want to know what kind of toys are inside. This function is like a helper that looks at the toys in the box and tells you what kind of toys they are.

It looks at each toy one by one, and if it's a toy that has a name (like a ball or a doll), it writes down the name. If it's a toy that has other toys inside (like a box with blocks inside), it looks at the toys inside the box and writes down their names too.

When it's done looking at all the toys, it gives you a list of all the names it found.
---

# parse_python_file ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of LEGOs, and inside the box, there are lots of different LEGO pieces like cars, houses, and animals. But you can't see what's inside the box because it's closed.

This special tool, called "parse_python_file", is like a key that opens the box. When you use the key, it looks inside the box and finds all the different LEGO pieces.

It then takes each piece and writes down its name, what it is (like a car or a house), where it is in the box (like on page 3), and what it looks like (like a picture of a car).

The tool also looks for special things like instructions on how to build the LEGO pieces, and it writes those down too.

Finally, the tool puts all the information it found into a special report, like a list of all the LEGO pieces and what they look like. That's what the "parse_python_file" tool does!
---

# extract_source_snippet ELIV

Imagine you have a big book with lots of pages. You want to read a special part of the book, but you don't want to read the whole thing. This function helps you find that special part.

It's like a key that opens a door to a specific page in the book. You tell it which page to start with and which page to end with, and it gives you all the words between those pages.

If the book doesn't exist or you can't open it, it will tell you that there's a problem. But if everything is okay, it will give you the special part of the book that you wanted to read.
---

# _build_tldr_prompt ELIV

Imagine you have a special box that needs to be explained in a few words. This box has a name, and it does something special. 

The `_build_tldr_prompt` function is like a helper that makes a special message to explain the box. It takes some information about the box, like its name, what it does, and what it depends on.

The helper looks at the information and makes a message that says something like: "This box is called [name], and it does [what it does]. It depends on [what it depends on]. Can you explain it in a few words?"

The helper then gives this message to a special computer that can understand it, and the computer will try to make a short explanation of the box.
---

# _generate_tldr_async ELIV

Imagine you have a special machine that can help you write a short summary about a thing, like a toy or a book. This machine is like a super smart friend who can read and write really fast.

The _generate_tldr_async function is like a key that opens the door to this machine. When you give it some information about the thing you want a summary for, it goes to the machine and says, "Hey, can you write a short summary about this?"

The machine tries to write the summary, and if it works, the function gets the summary and says, "Yay, I got it!" If the machine makes a mistake, the function says, "Oh no, something went wrong!" and tries to fix it. If it can't fix it, it says, "Sorry, I couldn't get the summary."
---

# generate_tldr_content ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of toys, and you want to tell your friend what's inside the box in just a few words. That's kind of what this function does. It takes some information about a special thing called a "symbol" and uses a magic tool to make a short summary of it. It's like a key that helps us understand what the symbol does, so we can tell others about it easily.
---

# _build_deep_prompt ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of LEGOs, and you want to build a really cool castle. But, you need some help from your friends who have different kinds of LEGOs. 

This special tool, called `_build_deep_prompt`, helps us write a message to our friends who are really good at building things (like a super smart LEGO builder). 

We give it some information about the castle we want to build, like what it's called, what kind of LEGOs we're using, and what it does. 

Then, it makes a special message that says: "Hey, friends! I need your help building this castle. Here's what I know about it: what it's called, what kind of LEGOs I'm using, and what it does. Can you help me figure out how to make it really cool?"

It's like giving a key to the LEGO builder that says: "Hey, here's what I need help with. Can you make it awesome?"
---

# _generate_deep_content_async ELIV

Imagine you have a super smart friend who can help you understand a big puzzle. This special friend is like a magic key that can open a door to a secret room.

The magic key is called "_generate_deep_content_async". When you give it some information, like a puzzle piece, it goes to the secret room and asks the super smart friend to help you understand the puzzle.

The super smart friend looks at the puzzle and gives you a detailed explanation. But if the puzzle is too hard, the super smart friend might say "I don't know" and the magic key will tell you that.

If the super smart friend says "I don't know", the magic key will also tell you why it couldn't help. It's like the magic key is saying "I tried my best, but I couldn't open the door".
---

# generate_deep_content ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of LEGOs, and you want to know what each LEGO piece does. This function is like a special tool that helps you figure out what each LEGO piece does.

It takes three things from you: 

- What the LEGO piece is called
- What other LEGO pieces it works with
- A little bit of the LEGO piece's instructions

Then, it uses a super smart computer to look at all this information and make a special report about the LEGO piece. The report is like a big sign that says what the LEGO piece does and how it works.

If the computer can't make the report, it will tell you that it couldn't do it. But if it can, it will give you the report as a special kind of text that you can read.
---

# _build_eliv_prompt ELIV

Let me explain this code to you in a super simple way.

Imagine you have a toy box full of different toys, and each toy has a special job. This code is like a helper that makes a special message to explain what each toy does in a way that's easy to understand.

Here's how it works:

1. It looks at the toy (or "symbol") and finds out its name, what kind of toy it is, and what it's supposed to do.
2. It then makes a list of things that help explain what the toy does, like what it says on a label or what it's connected to.
3. It puts all those things together into a special message that says something like: "Hey, this toy is called [name] and it does [job]. It works with [other toys] and here's what it looks like: [code]."
4. The message is then sent to a special helper called a "LLM" (like a super smart friend) that makes the explanation sound like it's talking to a 5-year-old.

The code is like a recipe that says: "Hey, take this information about the toy, mix it together with some special words, and then send it to the LLM to make it sound fun and easy to understand!"

Does that make sense?
---

# _generate_eliv_async ELIV

Imagine you have a special machine that can understand code. This machine is like a super smart friend who can explain things to you.

The _generate_eliv_async function is like a key that opens the door to this machine. When you give it some information, like what code you want to understand and what it's about, it uses the key to ask the machine for help.

The machine then gives back an answer, and the function takes that answer and makes it into a special report. This report is like a summary of what the machine said.

If the machine makes a mistake, the function tries to fix it. If it can't fix it, it tells you that the machine made a mistake and what went wrong.
---

# generate_eliv_content ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of toys, but you don't know what each toy does. This special helper, called "generate_eliv_content", is like a magic key that opens the box and explains what each toy does in a way that's easy to understand.

It takes three things: 

1. What the toy is called and what it does.
2. What other toys it works with.
3. A little bit of the toy's instructions.

Then, it uses a special computer friend to explain the toy in a way that's easy to understand. It's like asking a friend to explain something to you, and they break it down in a way that makes sense.
---

# validate_generated_docs ELIV

Imagine you have a special box where you keep all the information about a toy. This box is like a key that helps people understand what the toy does.

The "validate_generated_docs" function is like a helper who checks if the information in the box is correct. It looks at two things: a short summary (like a title) and a longer explanation (like a story).

The helper checks if the title and story are not empty, and if they are not too long. If they are, it writes a message saying what's wrong. If everything is okay, it says "yes, the box is correct!" and if there are any problems, it says "no, the box has some issues!"
---

# write_documentation_files ELIV

Imagine you have a special book about a game you love. You want to tell others about the game, but you need to write it in a way that's easy to understand.

This special tool, called `write_documentation_files`, helps you write three kinds of notes about your game book:

1. A short note that says what the game is about (like a title).
2. A longer note that explains the game in more detail (like a summary).
3. A special note that helps others understand the game's secrets (like a secret code).

If you want to write these notes in a special folder, you can tell the tool where to put them. If not, it will put them in a folder next to your game book.

The tool also makes sure that the folder exists, and it overwrites any old notes if you want to update them. Finally, it makes a copy of the notes in a special place, so others can see them too.
---

# _generate_single_symbol_docs ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of toys, and inside the box, there are lots of different toys with names like "car" and "doll". This special helper, called `_generate_single_symbol_docs`, is like a magic key that opens the box and finds the information about each toy.

It looks at the toy's name, checks if it's a real toy, and then finds three special things about the toy: a short description, a longer description, and some extra information. If the toy is not real, it tells us that too.

The helper is careful not to let too many people open the box at the same time, so it uses a special rule to make sure it's safe. And when it's all done, it gives us the information about the toy, like its name, if it's real, and the three special things we found.
---

# process_single_file_async ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of toys, and you want to make a special book about each toy. This special book will tell you what the toy is, what it does, and how it works.

This code is like a robot that helps you make those special books. It takes one toy at a time, reads about it, and writes a book about it. It can even write many books at the same time, like a super-fast writer!

The robot checks if the toy is real and if it's a toy that can be written about. If it's not a real toy, it says "oops, can't write about that one!"

Then, it reads about the toy and makes a list of all the things it needs to write about. It sends those things to a special helper, like a librarian, who writes about each thing and sends it back.

The robot takes all those writings and puts them together into a big book. If there's nothing to write about, it says "oh well, can't write a book about that one!"

Finally, it writes the book and says "yay, I wrote a book about that toy!"
---

# process_single_file ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of toys, and you want to make a special book about each toy. This function helps you do that.

It takes a special key (called a "target_path") that says which toy box to look at. Then it uses a special machine (called a "LLM") to write a short description and a longer story about each toy.

It also checks to make sure everything is correct, and then writes the book about the toys in a special place. If it all works, it says "yes!" (which is like returning True). If something goes wrong, it says "no!" (which is like returning False).
---

# _update_module_brief ELIV

Imagine you have a big box of toys, and inside the box, there are lots of smaller boxes with different toys in each one. This function helps make a special list of what's inside each smaller box, so people can easily see what they have.

It looks at all the smaller boxes, reads what's written on the labels, and then uses a special computer to make a short summary of what's inside each box. It writes this summary on a special piece of paper, and puts it in two places: one in the smaller box, and one in a big box that has all the smaller boxes.

If there's something special that says not to do this, it won't make the summary. And if it can't make the summary for some reason, it will say "oops, can't do it!"
---

# process_directory ELIV

Imagine you have a big box full of toys, and inside the box, there are smaller boxes with more toys. This function helps us look at all the toys in the big box and the smaller boxes, and it makes a special list of what's inside each box.

It also looks for a special key (called "__init__.py") that helps us know what's inside each box. If we find that key, it makes a special note about what's inside the box, so we can remember later.

If we want to look at all the boxes in the whole house, not just the ones in the big box, we can tell the function to do that. And if we want to put the special notes in a different place, we can tell the function where to put them.

The function is like a helper that makes it easy to look at all the toys and make notes about what's inside each box.
