      "tldr": "The `__all__` constant is used to specify the list of symbols that will be exported by the module when it is imported using the `from module import *` syntax. \n\nIt does not make any calls or use any types, but it imports several modules from the vivarium/scout package.",
      "deep": "## Logic Overview\nThe provided code defines a Python constant `__all__` which is a list of strings. This list contains the names of classes, functions, or variables that are intended to be imported when using the `from module import *` syntax. The main steps in this code are:\n- Definition of the `__all__` constant.\n- Specification of the names to be included in the `__all__` list.\n\nThe flow of this code is straightforward: it simply defines what symbols will be exported by the module when imported using the wildcard (`*`) syntax.\n\n## Dependency Interactions\nThe code does not directly use any of the traced calls. However, it does import several modules from the `vivarium/scout` package:\n- `vivarium/scout/audit.py`\n- `vivarium/scout/config.py`\n- `vivarium/scout/ignore.py`\n- `vivarium/scout/router.py`\n- `vivarium/scout/validator.py`\n\nThese imports suggest that the classes, functions, or variables listed in `__all__` are likely defined in one or more of these imported modules. The names listed in `__all__` are:\n- `AuditLog`\n- `IgnorePatterns`\n- `ScoutConfig`\n- `TriggerRouter`\n- `ValidationResult`\n- `Validator`\n- `validate_location`\n\n## Potential Considerations\nThe code does not contain any explicit error handling or performance optimizations. However, some potential considerations based on the provided code include:\n- The `__all__` constant only includes specific names, which may prevent accidental imports of internal implementation details.\n- The lack of any conditional logic or dynamic modification of the `__all__` list suggests that the set of exported symbols is fixed and does not depend on any external factors.\n- There are no explicit checks or handling for cases where the listed names are not defined in the imported modules.\n\n## Signature\nN/A",
