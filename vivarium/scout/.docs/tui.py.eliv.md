# _render_header ELIV

Imagine you have a special notebook that you use to keep track of your friends' names and their favorite things. This notebook is like a special computer screen that shows you information.

The `_render_header` function is like a helper that makes a title for your notebook. It says "Scout Configuration" in a fancy way, with colors and bold letters.

When you ask the helper to make the title, it tries to use a special tool to make it look nice. If it can't find that tool, it just uses a simple title instead.

So, the helper makes a title for your notebook, and you can use it to help you remember important things!

# run_config_tui ELIV

Imagine you have a special box where you can store your secrets. This box is called a "config" box. 

The "run_config_tui" function is like a key that opens this box. When you use the key, it lets you go inside the box and change the secrets if you want to.

The box has three main parts: triggers, limits, and patterns. Triggers are like alarms that go off when something happens. Limits are like rules that say how much you can spend. Patterns are like special codes that help you find the things you want to trigger or limit.

When you open the box with the key, you can choose what you want to do. You can edit the triggers, limits, or patterns. You can also save the changes you make, or go back to the way things were before.

If you want to save the changes, the key will help you write them down in a special book called a "config file". This way, you can remember the secrets you stored in the box.
