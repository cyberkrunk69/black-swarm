This constant does not appear to be used in any conditional statements, loops, or functions within the provided source code. The assignment is a straightforward, one-step process.\n\n## Dependency Interactions\nThere are no traced calls, types, or imports used in the definition or assignment of the `_MODULE_MD_NAME` constant. As a result, there are no dependency interactions to analyze.\n\n## Potential Considerations\nSince the constant is not used in any conditional statements or functions, there are no apparent edge cases or error handling mechanisms to consider. The performance impact of this constant is negligible, as it is simply a string assignment. However, without more context or surrounding code, it is unclear how this constant will be used or if it will have any significant effects on the overall program.\n\n## Signature\nN/A",

The main steps are:\n1. Resolve the input file path to an absolute path using `Path(file_path).resolve()`.\n2. Initialize a `parent` variable to the parent directory of the resolved file path.\n3. Enter a loop that continues until the `parent` directory is either the `root` directory or its parent.\n4. Inside the loop, check if the `parent` directory contains an `__init__.py` file.
