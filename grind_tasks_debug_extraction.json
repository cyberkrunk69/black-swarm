Debug why: (1) Check what patterns it looks for in responses, (2) Check if the extraction logic is working, (3) Test with a simple example. Then FIX IT so code blocks in responses get extracted and saved as files. OUTPUT: Fixed groq_code_extractor.py that actually extracts and saves code from responses.",
