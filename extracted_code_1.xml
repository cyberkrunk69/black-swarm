Integration Instructions for Adding Verification to `grind_spawner_unified.py`

1. **Import to add at the top of `grind_spawner_unified.py`**

   ```python
   from verification_fix import verify_changes
   ```

   *Place this line after the existing import statements (typically after line 1‑20).*

2. **Exact line number where verification should be called**

   Insert the verification call **after the surgical‑edit block that ends around line 394** (i.e., after the code that extracts `extracted_code`).  
   Use line **398** as the insertion point (adjust if the file has shifted, but keep it immediately after the extraction logic).

3. **Code to insert (with proper indentation)**  

   ```python
   # ---- Verification Hook -------------------------------------------------
   # Verify the extracted and edited code before any further processing.
   verify_changes(saved_files, edited_files, extracted_code)
   # -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   ```

   *Indentation should match the surrounding block (normally 4 spaces).*

4. **Variables that are available at this point**

   - `saved_files` : `dict` – mapping of file names to their original content before any edits.  
   - `edited_files` : `dict` – mapping of file names to their content after the surgical edits.  
   - `extracted_code` : `str` – the code snippet that was just extracted for further handling.  
   - Any other locals defined earlier in the same function (e.g., `file_path`, `metadata`) are also in scope, but the verification function only requires the three listed above.
