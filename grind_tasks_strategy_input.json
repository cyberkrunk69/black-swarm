Goal: Move fast, topple verticals, maintain architectural secrecy until market position is unassailable. Competitive advantage: (1) Assembled system already operational, (2) Extreme cost efficiency via Groq, (3) Knowledge base scraper can target any vertical, (4) Anthropic can't adopt this model without cannibalizing their business. Question: What are the critical paths to revenue in the next 2 days? What should be prioritized for maximum velocity? Which verticals are most vulnerable to rapid knowledge-base-driven disruption?",
