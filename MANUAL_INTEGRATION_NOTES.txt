SAFETY_GATEWAY.PY CHANGES (APPLY MANUALLY):

Add the following classes and methods to safety_gateway.py:
- ConstitutionalChecker class with validate_path, check_read_only, and log_file_operation methods
- SafetyGateway class with an __init__ method that creates a ConstitutionalChecker object and an access_file method that uses the ConstitutionalChecker to validate paths and log file operations
Additionally, create a constraints.json file to store allowed paths and read-only paths, and modify the ConstitutionalChecker to load these constraints from the file.
