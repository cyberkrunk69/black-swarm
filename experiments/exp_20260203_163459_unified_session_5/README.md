## ❓ FAQ  

**Is it really free?**  
Yes! All core features are 100 % free. Optional premium skins are available but never required.

**Does it work offline?**  
The player buffers the next few minutes of audio, so brief network drops won’t interrupt playback. Full offline mode requires a tiny pre‑download (under 5 MB).

**Do I need an account?**  
No. We respect your privacy—no sign‑ups, no data collection beyond the stream itself.

**Can I embed the radio on my own site?**  
Absolutely. Click “Embed” in the player to copy a one‑line HTML snippet.

**What devices are supported?**  
Any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox) on desktop, tablet, or phone. Smart‑speaker integration is coming soon.
