Interdimensional Radio streams bizarre, never‑heard‑before audio from parallel worlds straight to your browser. No accounts, no downloads, just click‑and‑listen. It’s like tuning a cosmic FM dial, but the stations are *actual* alternate realities.

## ❓ FAQ  

**Is it really free?**  
Yes! All streams are powered by community‑hosted nodes. No hidden fees, no subscription.

You need an internet connection to fetch the interdimensional feed. However, you can download a 5‑minute “offline capsule” from any channel to listen later.

Just a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Mobile works too.

**Is my data safe?**  
We never store personal info. All streams are anonymous and encrypted.

**Can I create my own channel?**  
Soon! A “Create Your Reality” button is in the roadmap.
