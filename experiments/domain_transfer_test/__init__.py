```python
# This package contains experimental scripts that invoke the benchmark suite.
# Keeping it empty allows Python to treat the directory as a module.
```
# This package contains experimental scripts for the cross‑domain transfer prototype.
# This package holds experimental scripts that run the
# cross‑domain transfer benchmarks defined in
# `benchmarks/transfer_learning_suite.py`.
# No code is needed here – the directory exists so the
# Python import system can locate the experiment modules.
