Date: 2026-02-04

Unmerged Files Detected:
1. experiments/exp_20260203_220216_unified_session_120/model_v2.py
2. experiments/exp_20260203_220216_unified_session_120/data_preprocess_v1.py
3. experiments/exp_20260203_220216_unified_session_120/analysis_notebook.ipynb

Validation Results:
- model_v2.py: ✅ Passed validation_pipeline.py
- data_preprocess_v1.py: ✅ Passed validation_pipeline.py
- analysis_notebook.ipynb: ❌ Failed validation (missing required metadata)

Git Automation Actions:
- model_v2.py → Committed with message: "Integrate model_v2.py: validated and ready for mainline."
- data_preprocess_v1.py → Committed with message: "Integrate data_preprocess_v1.py: validated and ready for mainline."
- analysis_notebook.ipynb → No commit performed due to validation failure.

Overall Integration Status: Partial success. Two files merged to mainline; one file requires fixing before integration.

Next Steps:
1. Review and update analysis_notebook.ipynb to include required metadata.
2. Re-run validation_pipeline.py on the updated notebook.
3. Execute git_automation.py again for the notebook once validation passes.
