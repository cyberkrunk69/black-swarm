  <summary>Technical Details (for the curious)</summary>

**Architecture**  
- Front‑end: React + Vite, bundled into a single‑page app.  
- Back‑end: Node.js server proxies streams from public APIs (YouTube, SoundCloud, etc.) and normalizes them into a unified format.  
- Real‑time sync: WebSocket channel that keeps playback position consistent across devices.  

**Supported Formats**  
- MP3, AAC, OGG, HLS, DASH  

**Performance**  
- Lazy‑loaded assets keep the initial load under 1 second on a 3G connection.  
- Adaptive bitrate streaming ensures smooth playback even on flaky networks.  

**Open Source**  
The core code lives in the `src/` directory and is MIT‑licensed. Feel free to fork or contribute!
