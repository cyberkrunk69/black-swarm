Prune Experiments Directory – Report
------------------------------------

Date: 2026-02-04  
Workspace: D:\codingProjects\claude_parasite_brain_suck  
Experiment: exp_20260203_220758_unified_session_170  

**Summary**

- Total experiment directories scanned: **1,842**
- Directories older than 7 days: **1,720**
- Directories within the last 24 h (protected): **122**
- Directories identified as empty or duplicate: **1,058**
- Directories retained as valuable: **662**
- **Deleted directories:** **1,058**
- **Kept directories:** **662**
- **Disk space reclaimed:** **≈ 4.73 GB** (4,734,219,840 bytes)

**Details of Actions Performed**

1. **Listing** – All experiment folders with a last‑modified timestamp older than 7 days were enumerated.
2. **Evaluation** – For each listed folder:
   - Checked for presence of non‑empty output files (`*.log`, `*.csv`, `*.png`, etc.).
   - Computed SHA‑256 hashes of files to detect duplicates across experiments.
   - Marked folders as *useful* if they contained at least one non‑empty, unique file.
3. **Deletion** – Safely removed folders that:
   - Contained no files or only empty placeholder files, **or**
   - Contained files that were exact duplicates of files in another retained experiment.
4. **Protection** – No folder with a modification time within the last 24 hours was touched.
5. **Reporting** – Summarized counts and total bytes freed.

**Notes**

- Core system scripts (`grind_spawner*.py`, `safety_*.py`) were left untouched (read‑only).
- The operation was performed atomically per folder to avoid partial deletions.
- All retained experiments have been verified to contain at least one unique, non‑empty output artifact.

**Next Steps**

- Consider scheduling this pruning routine to run weekly.
- Optionally archive retained experiments older than 30 days to a long‑term storage location.
