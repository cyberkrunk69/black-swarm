## ❓ FAQ

**Is it really free?**  
Yes! All channels are free to listen to. We only accept optional donations to keep the servers humming.

**Does it work offline?**  
You can enable a short “buffer” mode that caches the last 30 seconds of audio, but the core experience needs an internet connection.

**Do I need an account?**  
Nope. No sign‑ups, no passwords—just click and listen.

**Can I share a conversation with friends?**  
Absolutely. Click the “Share” button to copy a link that opens the exact same channel at the same moment.

**What browsers are supported?**  
Modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) on desktop or mobile. Older browsers may miss some visual polish.
