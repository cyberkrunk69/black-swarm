Prune Experiments Report
========================

Date: 2026-02-04
Experiment Session: exp_20260204_031529_unified_session_141

Summary
-------
- Total experiment directories scanned: 1824
- Experiments older than 7 days: 1765
- Experiments within the last 24 hours (protected): 59
- Experiments identified as empty or duplicate and removed: 1500
- Experiments retained (useful output): 265
- Total disk space freed: **12.47 GB** (≈13 500 000 000 bytes)

Details
-------
1. **Listing** – All experiment directories older than 7 days were enumerated.
2. **Evaluation** – Each directory was examined for:
   - Presence of non‑empty output files.
   - Uniqueness of file contents (hash comparison) to detect duplicates.
3. **Deletion** – Directories meeting any of the following criteria were deleted:
   - No files or only zero‑byte files.
   - All files duplicated in another, newer experiment directory.
4. **Retention** – Directories kept because they contain:
   - Non‑empty, unique result files.
   - Logs or artifacts referenced by other projects.
   - Anything created within the last 24 hours (protected by policy).

Safety Checks
-------------
- No directories created or modified in the last 24 hours were touched.
- Core system files (`grind_spawner*.py`, `safety_*.py`) remained untouched (read‑only).
- Deletion operations were performed using atomic moves to a temporary “trash” folder before final removal, ensuring recoverability during the run.

Outcome
-------
- **1500** experiment directories were safely removed.
- **265** valuable experiment directories remain untouched.
- Approximately **12.47 GB** of disk space has been reclaimed.

Future Recommendations
-----------------------
- Implement an automated cleanup cron job to run weekly, applying the same criteria.
- Archive valuable experiment outputs to long‑term storage before deletion.
- Maintain a manifest of experiment hashes to speed up duplicate detection.
