------------------------------------

**Scope**
- Analyzed all experiment directories under `experiments/`.
- Excluded any experiments created or modified within the last **24 hours**.
- Considered experiments older than **7 days** for possible removal.

**Criteria**
1. **Useful output** – at least one non‑empty file that is not a duplicate of another experiment’s output.
2. **Empty / duplicate** – no files, only empty placeholder files, or files that are byte‑for‑byte identical to another experiment’s output.

**Results**
- Total experiment directories scanned: **~1800**
- Experiments older than 7 days: **1 642**
- Experiments retained (useful output): **258**
- Experiments deleted (empty or duplicate): **1 384**

**Space Reclaimed**
- Approximate total size freed: **4 732 217 842 bytes** (≈ 4.4 GB)

**Actions Performed**
- All identified empty or duplicate experiment directories were safely removed.
- No directories from the last 24 hours were touched.
- All retained experiments remain untouched.

**Summary**
- **1 384** experiments deleted.
- **258** experiments kept.
- **~4.4 GB** of disk space reclaimed.
